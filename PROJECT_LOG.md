# SNF News Aggregator - Project Log

## 2025-10-10

### 19:52 UTC - Automatic Documentation System Setup
**Action**: Created comprehensive automatic documentation system
**Changes**:
- Created `.claudemd` rules file with update protocols
- Created `CONTEXT.md` with full project overview
- Created `PROJECT_LOG.md` (this file) for action tracking
- Created `TODO.md` for task management

**Why**: To ensure project continuity across chat sessions and provide clear context for any new collaborator or AI assistant picking up the project.

### 18:04 UTC - Resumed Article Analysis (Session 2)
**Action**: Restarted backend server after travel
**Status**: Server analyzing remaining ~519 articles
**Progress**: Continuing from ~290 articles completed

---

### 17:34 UTC - Paused Analysis for Travel
**Action**: Stopped server to allow computer transport
**Status**: ~290 articles analyzed and saved
**Result**: All progress preserved in analyzed-articles.json

---

### 16:57 UTC - Full Batch Analysis Started
**Action**: Removed test mode limit and started analyzing all 809 articles
**Changes**: Deleted test mode check (lines 355-358 in server/index.js)
**Status**: Successfully analyzing articles at ~3 seconds per article
**Validation**:
- First 79 articles completed successfully
- All include scope and state fields
- No JSON parsing errors
- No null value crashes

---

### 16:45 UTC - Successful Test Run (1 Article)
**Action**: Tested enhanced prompt with single article
**Test Article**: "3 Alabama nursing homes among the best in the nation"
**Result**: âœ“ SUCCESS
**Validation**:
- Article analyzed with all 9 fields present
- Geographic scope correctly identified: "State"
- State code correctly identified: "AL"
- JSON extraction worked perfectly
- No crashes or null values

**Test Output**:
```json
{
  "scope": "State",
  "state": "AL",
  "keyInsights": [...],
  "complianceTimeline": {...},
  "financialImpact": "...",
  "whoNeedsToKnow": [...],
  "actionItems": {...},
  "risks": [...],
  "relevanceReasoning": "..."
}
```

---

### 16:30 UTC - Fixed Null Handling Bug
**Problem**: Server crashed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'url')`
**Root Cause**: When `analyzeArticleWithAI()` failed and returned null, it was pushed to array. Later, `findNewArticles()` tried to access `.url` on null values.

**Solution**:
1. Added null check before pushing to array (lines 360-362):
```javascript
const analyzedArticle = await analyzeArticleWithAI(article)
if (analyzedArticle) {
  analyzedNewArticles.push(analyzedArticle)
}
```

2. Added null filtering when loading existing articles (lines 68-70):
```javascript
const articles = JSON.parse(data);
return articles.filter(article => article !== null);
```

**User Action**: User directed to stop server, delete corrupted analyzed-articles.json, implement fix, then restart.

---

### 16:15 UTC - Added Test Mode
**Action**: Created test mode to analyze just 1 article before full batch
**Changes**: Added test mode limiter (lines 355-358):
```javascript
if (analyzedNewArticles.length >= 1) {
  console.log('TEST MODE: Stopping after 1 article');
  break;
}
```
**Why**: To validate enhanced prompt and JSON extraction work correctly before running 809 articles (~40 minute process).

---

### 16:00 UTC - Enhanced JSON Extraction
**Problem**: Claude returning prose + JSON instead of pure JSON, causing parse failures
**Solution**: Implemented robust JSON boundary detection and extraction

**Changes to server/index.js**:
1. Line 186: Added emphatic JSON-only instruction at prompt start
2. Line 258: Added reminder instruction at prompt end
3. Lines 282-296: Added JSON boundary detection and extraction:
   - Find first `{` and last `}` in response
   - Extract only the JSON object portion
   - Validate boundaries exist before parsing
   - Error if no JSON object found

**Code**:
```javascript
const jsonStart = cleanedText.indexOf('{');
const jsonEnd = cleanedText.lastIndexOf('}');

if (jsonStart === -1 || jsonEnd === -1) {
  throw new Error('No JSON object found in response');
}

cleanedText = cleanedText.substring(jsonStart, jsonEnd + 1);
const analysis = JSON.parse(cleanedText);
```

---

### 15:30 UTC - Added Geographic Scope Detection
**Action**: Enhanced AI analysis prompt to include geographic scope identification
**Changes**: Added to AI prompt (lines 224-228, 251-253):
- New analysis section: "Geographic Scope"
- Prompt asks for scope classification (National/State/Regional/Local)
- Prompt asks for 2-letter state code if state-specific
- Added `scope` and `state` fields to JSON response structure

**Why**: To enable filtering articles by geographic relevance and help SNF operators focus on news that affects their specific locations.

---

### 15:00 UTC - Google News RSS Integration
**Action**: Expanded from 1 RSS feed to 9 feeds (1 primary + 8 Google News)
**Changes**: Added 8 parallel Google News RSS feeds with SNF-related search terms
**Result**: Article coverage increased from ~10 to ~810 articles per fetch

**Search Terms Added**:
- "skilled nursing facility"
- "nursing home"
- "long-term care"
- "SNF Medicare"
- "nursing home regulation"
- "SNF staffing"
- "nursing home quality"
- "post-acute care"

**Why**: To provide comprehensive industry news coverage beyond the single specialized feed.

---
