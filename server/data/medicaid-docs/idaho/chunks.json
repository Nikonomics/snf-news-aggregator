SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT HISTORY 1. Supplemental Payment History Beginning in state fiscal year 2010, the state of Idaho implemented cost cutting measures in the nursing facility (NF) rate methodologies. The efficiency incentive add-on for indirect costs was removed, inflation from the cost reporting period to the rate year was removed, and the overall rate was subjected to a 2.7% reduction. As a result, the Department of Health and Welfare (Department) implemented an Upper Payment Limit (UPL) supplemental payment program to replace the lost funding from the rate reductions. The UPL program provides supplemental payments to NFs using a combination of provider assessments and intergovernmental transfers (IGT) to fund the state share of the supplemental payment. In the initial year of the UPL program, the payment was limited to cover the estimated losses providers incurred from the change in rate methodology. Later, the program was revised to pay providers the entire available UPL gap. UPL supplemental payments are based on the difference between what Medicare would have paid and what Medicaid did pay for NF services provided to Medicaid residents. That difference, or gap, can be distributed to providers as a supplemental payment. Currently, the UPL program provides approximately $59 million dollars of supplemental payments to all providers with the exception of the state owned and operated facilities. The Department currently contracts with two participating managed care organizations (MCOs) to administer a managed care program to dual-eligible beneficiaries. Enrollment in MCOs has increased over 30% since last year at the same time. Federal rules do not allow supplemental UPL payments on managed care days; therefore, the growing enrollment trend into MCOs will impact UPL payments that are based on traditional fee-for-service days. It is estimated that this reduction in fee-for-service days would reduce the supplemental payments by approximately $49 million. Under federal regulations, states have the flexibility to implement supplemental payment systems that are based on quality. The Department has formed a work group with the Idaho Health Care Association, American Health Care Association, other providers, and the consulting firm of Myers and Stauffer to develop the Nursing Facility Quality Payment Program system based on quality. The Department is appreciative of the collaboration and input received from state and national nursing facility representatives for improving quality of care and life for our most frail and elderly participants. This input has been informative to deliberations on the best way to move forward. This document summarizes the work group decisions, methodologies, plan details, and timelines of the proposed system.  page 3 2. QUALITY MEASURES 2. Quality Measures The goal of this new payment structure is to link supplemental payments to the quality of care provided by NFs participating in the Medicaid program. Linking payments to quality of care is a primary goal of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department, and provides a strong financial incentive to NFs to improve the quality of care and lives of the residents they serve. A. Quality of Care Measures The Department and NF industry representatives have reached consensus on the following nine measures, which leverage existing and readily accessible data. These measures capture common clinical outcomes for long-stay residents and are reflective of the overall quality of the NF. These represent reasonable indicators of quality of care and will be used in Idaho’s Nursing Facility Quality Payment Program. During initial discussions, the consensus was to utilize ten measures, but on October 1, 2019, CMS removed the measure to remove moderate to severe pain from their Five Star quality program. As a result, this measure was removed from",

As a result, this measure was removed from the calculation of the total quality based score for the Idaho Quality Payment Program.  Eight Minimum Data Set (MDS) long-stay quality measures. o These measures are derived from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) used by CMS in the Five Star quality rating program for NFs. o All NFs are required to submit data to a national MDS repository and CMS has made the data available to states to use in various rate-setting systems. o Data is calculated using a four-quarter average.  One PointRight® Long-Stay Hospitalization measure from the National Quality Forum endorsed measure about hospitalization rates. o Data is calculated from the most recent data available. This measure is an MDS-based, risk adjusted measure of the rate of hospitalization of long-stay patients of NFs averaged across the year, weighted by the number of stays in each quarter.

POINT ASSIGNMENT STEPS 3. Point Assignment Steps The quality payment parameters are determined using provider scores for all nine quality measures. Scores for all providers will be arrayed and payment tiers will be calculated. Percentages are assigned to each payment tier in order to determine the portion of each provider’s quality payments they are eligible to receive. Therefore, the payment tier that each provider falls into will be used to determine their quality payment. The payment percentages by tier are described in Section 4. A. Base Year for Payment Tiers Provider quality payments will be based on the payment tier their score falls within. The options discussed for the tier calculations were to either recalculate them annually or use a base period where the payment tiers will remain intact for several years. The work group concluded that a base period is preferable in order for the providers to track their progress over a five-year period. The base period will be used to compile provider scores and to calculate payment tiers. The base year tiers will then be used to determine payments moving forward. Following is a high-level summary of the base year concepts:  Base year – Quality scores captured for the most current data available as of 12/31/17.  Tier groups – The 2017 quality scores will establish three payment tiers that will be applied until a rebase occurs.  Years in use before a rebase is evaluated – The payment tiers will remain in place through the SFY 2025 payments and then will be reevaluated. Refer to Table 3.2. Following is a summary of the steps that will be taken to calculate the base year tiers and point ranges: Table 3.1 Base Year Payment Tier Calculation Steps Step Topic Discussion and Tiers Gather the scores using the data sources described in Table 2.1. 3 Score tabulation 2 Data period Scores available as of 12/31/17 1 Capture provider scores Sum the scores for all 9 measures to determine a total score for each provider 4 Calculate 2017 base year point ranges for the 3 Tiers Using the array of all provider scores, calculate 3 Tiers as follows. Refer to Appendix A for detail calculations.

Quality Score Cut Points Point values assigned to each quality measure will remain unchanged until a rebase occurs. Refer to Appendix B and C for the point value range for each quality measure. C. Anomalies in the Data In the cases of data anomalies or missing data, the work group decided on the following methods: i. Missing Quality Measure Scores While most Idaho NFs have data for all nine of the measures, some do not. When quality measure data is missing, the work group decided to impute scores for each missing measure using the median score of all Idaho NFs. ii. Providers with Special Care Units For the quality measures identified below, providers expressed concern over the observed lower scores of NFs with Behavior Care Units (BCU) or those providing ventilator care.  Antipsychotic use for long-stay residents  ADLs decline The providers asserted that these special units may tend to score lower simply due to the nature of the residents served. For the two quality measures listed above, the work group proposed the following solutions:  Applicable only to providers with state designated units (currently BCU, and special care facilities under IDAPA 16.03.10.269.06.a) and those providing ventilator care.  Allow the provider the higher of their own score or the statewide median score of the non- unit providers for each measure. Any facility that met the BCU qualification requirements as of the beginning of the rate period within the quality measurement year would be considered a BCU for the quality measures calculations. Rate periods have a July 1 start date. iii. Quality Measure Treatment through COVID-19 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of providers experienced a decrease in their total scores for the quality measures listed in Table 2.1. Upon review of detail of the decrease in scores, it was determined that two quality measures were the main contributing factors for the decreases. Those quality measures were Decline in Late-Loss ADLs and Decline in Mobility. Decreases were expected in these areas because of the isolation protocols put into place in an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In order to address the decrease in scores, the Department opted to increase each provider’s total quality measure score by 40 points. The increase of 40 points will be in effect for SFY 2022. Due to continued effects of COVID-19, the Department applied the 40 point increase for SFY 2023 as well. When tiers are calculated for SFY 2024, the 40 points added to each provider’s score will be excluded. This will allow tiers for that period to not be negatively impacted by the Department’s decision to increase total quality scores by 40 points in SFY 2022 and SFY 2023.  page 6 3. POINT ASSIGNMENT STEPS D. Timeline After Base Year The quality payment calculations are performed annually with a goal of sending payment notice letters every August. The steps identified in Sections A and B above will be applied each year when gathering the quality measures. Following is the timeline and data sources for the program: Table 3.2 Data Sources and Base Year Timeline Medicaid QMs Based Days from on the Four Provider Quarter UPL Paid in Medicaid Rates FYE Average Base Year Payment SFY Paid Ending for Tiers Type 1 6/30/19 7/1/17 – 6/30/18 2016 12/31/17 12/31/17 Shadow 6/30/20 7/1/18 – 6/30/19 2017 12/31/18 12/31/17 Shadow 6/30/21 7/1/19 – 6/30/20 20182 12/31/19 12/31/17 Year 1 6/30/22 7/1/20 – 6/30/21 2019 12/31/20 12/31/17 Year 2 6/30/23 7/1/21 – 6/30/22 2020 12/31/21 12/31/17 Year 3 6/30/24 7/1/22 – 6/30/23 2021 12/31/22 12/31/17 Year 4 6/30/25 7/1/23 – 6/30/24 2022 12/31/23 12/31/17 Year 5 6/30/26 7/1/24 – 6/30/25 2023 12/31/24 Rebase 1 See Section 4E for description of shadow payments. 2 Beginning this year, days will be a combination of Idaho Medicaid Managed Care and traditional Medicaid.

All days will be captured for the available supplemental payment pool calculations.  page 7 4. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND PROVIDER ASSESSMENT 4. Supplemental Payment and Provider Assessment Calculations This section describes how payment tiers translate to payments. The Department will make the quality payments to providers once a year. A. Determine the Quality Payment Pool Historically, the supplemental payment pool has been determined as follows: Step 1) Calculate what Medicare would have paid each provider using Medicare RUG rates Step 2) Calculate what Medicaid did pay each provider Step 3) Calculate the UPL gap as Step 1 – Step 2 * traditional Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) patient days Step 4) Sum the UPL gap by each ownership class (private, government, state-owned) Step 5) Distribute the sum of the gap for each class to each provider based on their share of Medicaid days to the total Medicaid days in the class. Step 6) The result in Step 5 is the funding pool available to each provider. Based on their quality score, they will be paid a percentage of their own pool and not a percentage of the entire pool for the class. For the new quality measure system, a similar method will be used with the only exception being that instead of basing the gap calculation on only traditional Medicaid FFS days and payments, it will be based on traditional FFS days plus Idaho Medicaid managed care days and payments. The calculation will provide a UPL gap for each payer (FFS and each MCO) to determine the pool of dollars to distribute by each payer. Idaho Medicaid will issue payments for traditional FFS days. For the MCOs payments, Idaho Medicaid will provide a lump sum payment to each MCO and will also identify the calculated payment the MCO will issue to each facility. The calculation for the MCO payments related to managed care days will follow the same parameters as listed above. B. Payment Percentages Once each provider’s total available fund pool is determined, and their quality scores for the payment year have been tabulated, the following payment tier methodologies will be applied to their available pool: Table 4.1 Percentage of Each Provider’s Available Pool Paid by Tier Group Payments Based on Change in QM Score From Prior Year Improved by 40 Points Declined by 40 Points Tier or More No Change or More 1 100% 100% 100% 2 100% 100% 95% 3 100% 95% 90%  page 8 4. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND PROVIDER ASSESSMENT C. Undistributed Funds Because each provider will be paid between 90% and 100% of their available pool of funds, there may be excess funds available to distribute. The excess funds will be summed by ownership class and every provider in that class will receive a share of the undistributed pool based on their percent of FFS and Idaho managed care days to total FFS and Idaho manged care days in their ownership class. D. Provider Assessment The provider assessment is currently calculated once a year, at the same time the quality payments are calculated. The assessment has historically been set at an amount to cover the state share of the supplemental payments paid to privately owned providers plus an administrative fee for Myers and Stauffer to prepare the calculations. The assessment methodology will remain unchanged. Non-state government owned providers are exempt from the assessment and instead pay an IGT payment to the state to cover the state share of each provider’s payment. During the 2018 legislative session, Idaho State Veteran’s Home providers are now eligible to participate in the UPL payment program. These providers are state operated and are also exempt from the assessment. They will instead pay an IGT payment to the state to cover the state share of each provider’s payment. E. Shadow Payments The current UPL payment system will continue through the payment made in SFY ending 6/30/20 because it relies on patient days. This will allow providers time to learn and adapt to the new system and begin working to improve their quality scores in the hopes of receiving 100% of their available fund pool in the future. For the years leading up to the full implementation date, the work group decided that issuing shadow payment calculations would serve to remind providers to focus on quality care. In addition, the shadow payments will be in a format that will be educational to providers so they can learn the new system. The shadow payment will be issued annually along with each provider’s current UPL payment calculation. It will show the provider what they would have been paid",

The shadow payment will be issued annually along with each provider’s current UPL payment calculation. It will show the provider what they would have been paid had the new system been live. Providers will be issued quarterly reports that show their most recent quality scores. There will not be a shadow payment attached to the quarterly reports as shadow payments only occur annually. However, the report will show their quality scores so they can be aware of their score throughout the year. F. Calculated Tier and Percentage Payout During the second quarter of the calendar year, each provider will receive a Quality Standing report along with the standard quarterly report. The Quality Standing report will include the provider’s adjusted quality scores based on the four quarter average from the preceding calendar year, payment tier, and UPL payment percentage. Providers should review the Quality Standing  page 9 4. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND PROVIDER ASSESSMENT report to determine if they disagree with any of their scores. If a provider disagrees with their score, procedures outlined in Section G, Dispute Process, should be followed. G. Dispute Process The dispute process was created by the work group to address concerns that nursing facilities may not take individuals that have complex needs for fear those individuals may drive down quality scores. Any NF that believes the calculated quality scores do not reflect the actual quality care that was provided during the reported year is allowed to submit documentation to dispute their scores. NFs may only dispute the calculated quality scores as stated in the Quality Standing report issued in the second quarter following the end of the reporting year. The Dispute Process steps are as follows: Step 1) Each NF receives quarterly reports with raw quality measure scores. Any NF with concern that their quality scores are not reflective of the actual care provided should begin the research to determine the cause of the quality scores and compile supporting documentation. The burden of proof lies with the NF. The Department does not have the capability to compare one or more MDS assessments to another set of residents to determine the effect of changes in quality measure scores or to model the impact of one resident’s score and how it affects the total facility score. Step 2) After receiving the Quality Standing report, any NF wishing to dispute their quality scores must submit documentation supporting their position within 21 days from the send date as stated on the Quality Standing report. The submission of supporting documentation initiates the Dispute Process. Late submissions will not be accepted. Supporting documentation must be provided in an electronic format and transmitted via efax, email, or mail for encrypted data storage devices such as thumb drives. No paper documents will be accepted.

For the MDS-based measures (all others), points are based on data from 2015Q1 – 2015Q4. A higher QM value corresponds to better performance for all measures except functional improvement and successful community discharge where lower QM values correspond to better performance. 2The five new QMs (functional improvement, mobility decline, hospital readmission, ED visit, and community discharge) are being phased into the QM rating. In July 2016 each contributed half the points of the other measures. In January 2017, the thresholds will remain the same but the points associated with each will double. 3Indicates one of the five new QMs as of July 2016 contributing half the points of the other 11 QMs. Starting in January 2017, the new QMs will contribute the same number of points as the other measures. 4Thresholds for three quality measures were slightly changed on July 20, 2016 to correct errors in the earlier version of the TUG that was published on July 7, 2016. The thresholds that appeared in the July 7, 2016 version of the TUG were never used to calculate ratings that were publicly reported. 25 Appendix C.

Determination of BCU Status 10/16/18 Meeting – Discussed BCU approval process. Determined that if a facility met BCU qualifications at the beginning of the rate year within the Quality Measure period, they would be considered a BCU  Newly approved BCUs have to be approved for 6 months of the year to be eligible.  If a facility is a BCU at beginning of Rate Period (7/1), then it would be considered as a BCU for QM calculations. 18. Removal of Pain Quality Measure  As of 10/01/2019, CMS stopped collection and publishing information related to moderate to severe pain.  It has been decided to remove this Quality Measure from the Program. 6 Idaho Department of Health & Welfare Prepared by MSLC: 1/10/18; Updated: 10/15/18 Updated by BLTC: 1/19/18 Updated by MSLC: 05/01/19 Updated by MSLC: 07/20/20 Updated by MSLC: 5/17/21 Updated by MSLC: 10/14/22 Appendix D – NF Quality Program at a Glance Comparison of VBP Proposals for the 12/18/17 Meeting with DHW, NF Industry Representatives and MSLC 19. Considerations for COVID‐19  To counter‐act COVID‐19 effects to QM scores, the Department increased Total Adjusted QM scores by 40 points for all providers  The additional 40 point increase applies to SFY 2022 and 2023.

Should the handbook ever appear to contradict relevant provisions of Idaho or federal regulations, the regulations prevail. Any paper or digital copy of these documents is considered out of date except the version appearing on Gainwell Technologies’ Idaho Medicaid website. Providers must follow their provider type or service specific handbook as located in the Provider Guidelines. Handbooks in addition to this one which always apply to providers include: • General Billing Instructions; and • Glossary. Handbooks can only be used properly in context. Providers must be familiar with the handbooks that affect them and their services. The numbering in handbooks is also important to make note of as subsections rely on the content of the sections above them. Example Section 1.2.3(a) The Answer requires the reader to have also read Section 1, Section 1.2 and Section 1.2.3 to be able to properly apply Section 1.2.3(a). References are included throughout the handbook for provider and staff convenience. Not all applicable references have been incorporated into the handbook. Not all references provided are equal in weight. • Case Law: Includes references to court cases that established interpretations of law that states and providers would be required to follow. • CMS Guidance: These references reflect various Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid services. • Federal Regulations: These references are regulations from the federal level that affected policy development. Usually these include the Code of Federal Regulations, the Social Security Act and other statutes. They are required to be followed. • Idaho Medicaid Publications: These are communications from Idaho Medicaid to providers that were required to be followed when published. These are included in the handbook for historical reference. The provider handbook supersedes other communications unless the documents are listed in the Policies, Procedures, and Waivers webpage under policies in Medicaid Policies library. • Idaho State Plan: The State Plan is the agreement between the State of Idaho and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on how the State will administer its medical assistance program. • Professional Organizations: These references reflect various publications of professional organizations that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. Providers may or may not be required to follow these references, depending on the individual reference and its application to a provider’s licensure and scope of practice. • Scholarly Work: These references are publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid services. July 1, 2025 Page 1 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • State Regulations: These references are regulations from the state level that affected policy development. They usually include statute and IDAPA. They are required to be followed. Some citations may not be available on the internet. Copies of the documents may be requested with a public records request.

See the Participant Financial Responsibility section for more information; • To not bill a Medicaid participant unless the item or service is non-covered or excluded by Medicaid, and the provider complies with the Participant Financial Responsibility section. See Non-Covered and Excluded Services, which includes a list of excluded services, for more information; and • To assure Medicaid participants are not billed for “no-show” or missed appointments nor can they enter into an agreement to be responsible for any resulting fees. All correspondence sent to the provider’s mailing address on file with the State’s fiscal agent shall be deemed to be received by the Provider. Department correspondence is not forwarded July 1, 2025 Page 3 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers by a change of address with the U.S. Postal Service. All mail and checks are returned to Gainwell Technologies. July 1, 2025 Page 4 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 1.1. Employees and Contractors Providers are responsible for the recruiting, hiring, firing, training, supervision, scheduling, and payroll for their employees, subcontractors, or agents. The Provider shall maintain general liability insurance coverage, worker’s compensation, and unemployment insurance, and shall pay all FICA taxes and state and federal tax withholding for its employees. The Provider agrees to bill only for service providers who have the qualifications required for the type of service being delivered. Furthermore, providers assume sole responsibility for the actions of their employees and contractors acting on the provider’s behalf. This includes the accuracy of claims submitted as specified in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement.

July 1, 2025 Page 5 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 1.2. Documentation All providers are required to generate records at the time the service is delivered and to maintain documentation to fully document the extent of services submitted for Medicaid reimbursement. Services which have not been sufficiently documented are not reimbursable. The person delivering the services and any supervising providers must ensure all documentation is legible, complete, dated, time-stamped, and includes a written or electronic dated signature to attest that the records are a true and accurate account of the services delivered. 1.2.1. Additional Documentation Additional documentation requirements may vary by provider or service type and are listed in the appropriate sections of the provider type and specialty specific Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbooks. Providers should consult the applicable handbooks on the Medicaid Provider Portal prior to delivering or billing for services. 1.2.2. Amendments or Corrections Any records requiring amendment or corrections must be clearly and permanently identified and leave the original contents of the document legible. Amendments and corrections are intended to provide clarification and cannot be used to add new services for billing or retroactively establish medical necessity. Amendments and corrections separately require the author to be clearly identified with their credentials, a signature and the date of the changes. 1.2.3. Artificial Intelligence Documentation generated by artificial intelligence is not acceptable. 1.2.4. Electronic Transcription Documentation is acceptable when generated by software transcribing verbal notes to text. Providers are responsible for the accuracy of the transcription. 1.2.5. Signatures Handwritten or electronic signatures (including those captured by Electronic Visit Verification software certified by the Department) are acceptable. All signatures must be dated. Electronic signatures must meet the requirements in the Electronic Signatures subsection. For handwritten signatures, stamped and typed signatures are only allowed for providers with proof of a physical disability that prevents their signing. Records should be signed shortly after the service is provided with time allowed for transcription by a scribe. Signatures cannot be added to documents beyond that time frame, and scribes do not need to sign documents. Documentation signed by multiple providers is allowed, when one provider is supervising another if the rendering provider is clearly identified. If the Department determines a handwritten signature is illegible, a provider may submit a signature log or attestation with requested records to support the identity of the signer. A signature log must include a typed list of provider names, titles and credentials followed by the corresponding handwritten signature. Signature attestations must be signed and dated by the author of the illegible signature. Attestations must include a statement of the document’s validity, the name and credentials of the author, the date of service being attested to and the participant’s name and Medicaid Identification Number (MID). Attestations can also be used as documentation for missing signatures. July 1, 2025 Page 6 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers a) Electronic Signatures Idaho Medicaid will accept dated electronic signatures for provider orders and records to meet the requirements for documentation. The individual whose name is on the electronic signature and the provider bear the responsibility for authenticity. Each provider must develop written policies and procedures to assure complete, accurate, and authenticated records and at a minimum include: • Security provisions to protect against the use of an electronic signature by anyone other than the person to which the electronic signature belongs; • How the privacy and integrity of the record is protected; • A list of which records will be maintained and signed electronically; • How an e-signature code is assigned; • How passwords are assigned and the frequency for which they are changed in provider software; • Clarification on whether a digital signature, a digitized signature, or an electronic signature is being used, and the details",

The following are not considered acceptable electronic signatures and may not be accepted by Idaho Medicaid: (a) created by, (b) received by/for, (c) generated by/for, (d) administratively signed by, (e) dictated but not signed, (f) electronically signed to expedite delivery, or (g) proxy signature (signed via approval letter or statement). Providers are encouraged to review and apply HIPAA guidance on the U.S. Health & Human Services site: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html. As required by HIPAA-covered entities, the provider must ensure the software program used is set up so that the signer cannot deny having signed the document in the future, the signer’s identity is guaranteed at the time the signature was generated, and the document has not been altered since it was signed. Providers using Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) software to verify service delivery meet these requirements when their EVV software is certified by the Department or its contractor. 1.2.6. Retention of Records Providers are required to retain records of documented services submitted for Medicaid reimbursement for at least five (5) years from the date of service. Documentation must be made available immediately upon request from the Department, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), or any Department or CMS contractor acting in their official capacity. Documentation must be sufficient to substantiate the amount, duration, scope, and medical necessity of billed services. Documentation to support claims for services includes, but is not limited to, medical records, treatment plans, medical necessity justification, assessments, appointment sheets, patient accounts, financial records, or other records regardless of its form or media. Medicaid may recoup the payment and apply a penalty if proper documentation cannot be produced by the provider. Documentation created after a Department records request is made will not be accepted. Intentional deception or misrepresentation made with the knowledge that the deception could result in an unauthorized benefit constitutes fraud, and offending individuals will be referred for prosecution.

Ordering, Referring and Prescribing Providers As a condition of payment, provider’s claims designated in the Provider Types and Specialties, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook requires inclusion of an enrolled ordering, referring or prescribing (ORP) provider’s name and NPI. If the claims are submitted without an enrolled provider’s name and NPI, they will deny. Claims that come directly from Medicare to Idaho Medicaid will not require an enrolled ORP, but if the provider submits a manual claim it will deny without one. The definition for ordering, prescribing, and referring includes, but is not limited to: prescribing drugs or other covered items, sending a participants specimens to a laboratory for testing, ordering imaging/diagnostic services or durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics or supplies for a participant, referring a participant to another provider or certifying a participants need for covered items or services. Based on the State of Idaho’s medical licensing structure and statutes, the following individual provider types may order, refer, or prescribe healthcare services or supplies for participants of the Idaho Medicaid program. These services or supplies must be requested in accordance with the provider’s scope of practice and their licensure, which includes any certifications or credentials they possess. Eligible healthcare professionals are: • Dentists; • Licensed midwives; • Nurse practitioners; • Optometrists; • Pharmacists; • Physicians including residents, licensed bridge year physicians and licensed international medical graduates; • Physician assistants; • Podiatrists; and • Psychologists (except school-based psychologists, who are exempt). ORP providers must: • Enroll with Idaho Medicaid as a billing provider, a non-billing ORP, or a crossover provider; • Complete enrollment application; • Complete Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement; and • Retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of medical necessity for the services, equipment or supplies. Billing providers must: • Ensure all ORP providers are enrolled with Idaho Medicaid; • Obtain the name and the NPI of the ORP provider and include it on claims; and • Retain all documentation to support services billed Interns and students (except first-year physician residents) are not eligible to enroll as ORP providers. The teaching, admitting or supervising eligible healthcare professional, however, can review their documentation and perform the order or referral on their behalf.

Availability to Provide Services An agency may allow an employee to provide care or services on a provisional basis when certain criteria are met. The individual must complete and have notarized the Background Check Unit’s application. The agency must review the application for disqualifying incidents. Individuals with a disqualifying incident cannot provide services. Individuals failing to disclose information receive an unconditional denial and may be prosecuted. Agencies that prompt the individual to refrain from fully disclosing their history are subject to penalties including up to, but not limited to, recoupment, disenrollment from the Idaho Medicaid program, or prosecution. Individuals seeking licensure or certification are not eligible to provide services until a background check clearance is received. When the application contains no disqualifying incidents, the agency must decide based on the information provided if the individual is safe to provide services to participants. Services may be provided when there are no disqualifying incidents and the agency determines the individual is safe to provide services. Fingerprints must be submitted within twenty-one (21) days of application submission and the results of the background check must be reviewed by the agency within fourteen (14) days of a determination. Failure to do either or withdrawal of the application makes the individual no longer eligible to provide services. The Department may allow an extension for fingerprint submission at its discretion. Individuals without a clearance are only eligible to provide services to an agency for twenty- one (21) days in a rolling year. They cannot submit subsequent applications within that year to continue to work beyond the twenty-one (21) day period. If fingerprints are not received within sixty (60) days, the application is no longer valid, and the individual must begin a new application. When an individual receives a background check clearance, the agency must assess if they are fit for employment based on the results. When an agency becomes aware of any subsequent criminal convictions or child or adult protection issues, they must report the information immediately to the Background Check Unit. The agency may use the results of a previously completed background check at their discretion in some circumstances. The clearance from the background check must be within three (3) years of its determination. An individual is not eligible to",

Individuals receiving unconditional denials or inability to proceed are immediately unable to work. The Department may allow background check variances for clearance requirements at its discretion on a case-by-case basis with consideration of the underlying facts and circumstances. The Department may require a new background check at any time. If requested, the individual must provide a completed application and fingerprints within fourteen (14) days to maintain their eligibility to provide services. The Department may revoke a background check clearance when the individual fails to submit a new background check upon request, a subsequent background check finds a disqualifying incident, or fees are not paid in full. All background check applications, clearances, denials, and results from an Idaho State Policy background check must be retained by the agency and available upon request for five (5) years from separation of employment. a) References: Availability to Provide Services (i) State Regulations “Agency Responsibilities.” IDAPA 16.05.06, “Criminal History & Background Checks,” Sec. 060.

When the individual has a pending incident for a disqualifying event, the Department may issue a finding of inability to proceed. Documentation can be submitted by the individual for reconsideration within 120-days of an inability to proceed finding. The Department considers the underlying facts and circumstances of felony or misdemeanor conduct, including a guilty plea or admission when determining whether to issue a clearance, regardless of whether the individual received one (1) of the following: • A withheld judgement, • A dismissal, suspension, deferral, commutation, or a plea agreement where probation or restitution was or was not required, or • An order under Section 19-2604, Idaho Code, or other equivalent state law • A sealed record.

Background Check Variances Variances allow an individual to provide specific services when ineligible for a clearance. The Department may allow a variance for clearance requirements at its discretion on a case-by- case basis with consideration of the underlying facts and circumstances. Variances are not considered clearances and may be revoked at any time if a health or safety risk is identified. A granted variance does not set a precedent for future reviews. Medicaid peer support and recovery coaching providers can apply for a variance if their background check results in a denial due to prior convictions for drug and alcohol-related offenses. Factors for consideration include, but are not limited to the: • Severity or nature of the crime or finding; • Time period since the incidents occurred; • Number and pattern of incidents; • Circumstances that may determine risk of recidivism; • Relationship between the incidents and the position applied for; • Evidence of activities demonstrating rehabilitation; • Pardons by a state governor or the President of the United States; and • Falsification or omission of information during the application process. a) References: Background Check Variances (i) State Regulations “Department-Issued Variances.” IDAPA 16.03.26, “Medicaid Plan Benefits,” Sec. 003.

July 1, 2025 Page 20 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 2. Participant Financial Responsibility Providers rendering items or services to a participant must bill any third-party liable payor and Idaho Medicaid. Any payment made by Idaho Medicaid must be accepted as payment in full. This also includes claims with third-party liability where Medicaid’s reimbursement methodology considers the third-party payment to have covered the claim in full and no additional amount is paid by Medicaid. Providers cannot refuse to provide covered services because of potential third-party liability. Unless stated otherwise by the Department (e.g. Idaho Medicaid co-pays and share of cost) no additional payment may be collected from the participant either before or after Medicaid payment, regardless of a separate contract between the participant and the provider for assumption of liability. This includes, but is not limited to: • No-show or missed appointment fees; • Other insurer’s co-pays; • Failure on the part of the provider to submit a complete and correct claim to the Department or other payor; • Failure by the provider to submit a complete and correct request for prior authorization from the Department or other payor; • Claims voided by the provider; • Failure of the provider to follow any payor’s policy or procedure; or • Any recoupment or penalties the provider receives as a result of their action or inaction. Providers may bill a participant when a third-party payment (e.g. automotive insurance adjustment) was made to the participant instead of the provider, in which case the participant may be billed for an amount equal to that payment. Providers can only bill participants for non-covered or excluded items and services, if prior to rendering such services or providing such items, the provider informed the participant through a written notice that what they are receiving is not covered under Medicaid. Idaho Medicaid does not have an official format, but the notice must specify the non-covered/excluded service or item, the cost of each service or item, and be signed by the participant. If the participant chooses to obtain services not covered or excluded by Medicaid, it is the participant’s responsibility to pay for the services. See the Non-Covered and Excluded Services section for more information. Providers are exempt from the requirement to notify the participant in writing for services provided during any period where the participant was later found retroactively eligible for Medicaid coverage. However, providers must adhere to all other requirements of being a Medicaid provider. If the provider previously collected a payment that would not be allowed by Idaho Medicaid from a participant later found eligible, the payment must be refunded. See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information about billing non-covered services under GA, GX, GY and GZ modifiers, third-party liability, co-payments, share of cost and reimbursement methodologies.

When a provider verifies a participant’s eligibility for the service, a co-payment indicator of “Exempt” or $3.65 displays. Participants may only be charged a co-payment as specified by the provider handbook and when the reimbursement amount for the service is more than $36.50 in the Medicaid Fee Schedule. Services for wellness including preventive exams, and all medically necessary immunizations or family planning services are excluded from co-pay. These services are subject to a co-payment: • Ambulance services for a non-emergency; • Chiropractic; • Emergency room services for a non-emergency; • Podiatric; • Eye and vision services provided by an optometrist; • Therapy Services; • Medical Services; and • IHS, FQHC and RHC Services.

Share of Cost (SOC) Share of Cost (SOC) is a financial arrangement for a participant to pay a specific portion of the monthly costs associated with a service. Share of Cost is associated to participants eligible for the Adult Developmental Disabilities (DD) Waiver, Aged and Disabled Waiver (A&D), or residing in Skilled Nursing (SNF) or Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) Facilities (i.e., Long Term Care). There are three (3) eligibility categories (referred to as Rate Codes): • Rate Code 14: Developmental Disability Waiver; • Rate Code 15: Aged and Disabled Waiver; and • Rate Code 17: Skilled Nursing Facilities (Long Term Care) or ICF/IID Facilities. It is the provider’s responsibility to verify the participant’s SOC each month and collect this from the participant. The provider’s allowable reimbursement is reduced by the amount of the applicable SOC on a first claim in basis until the full amount of the SOC has been offset. Refer to Verifying Participant Eligibility and the Eligibility Verification section of the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide. Claims submitted with an applicable SOC must not span over multiple months. They must be billed within a single month on a claim. 2.3.1. Discrepancy Contact Information If the participant or provider believes that the SOC amount is based on outdated or incomplete information, the participant or participant’s personal representative should contact Self Reliance at 1 (877) 456-1233 to review the information used in the SOC calculation. If there is a variance between the SOC identified in the participant’s notification letter and what was reported on the participants SOC eligibility verification, send an e-mail to SOCdiscrepancies@dhw.idaho.gov, or fax to 1 (208) 334-5571 using the Fax Cover Sheet found on the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website, under Gainwell Technologies Forms. 2.3.2.

Reporting Provider Fraud The Medicaid Program Integrity Unit (MPIU) conducts reviews and investigations to determine whether or not a provider is incorrectly billing Medicaid. The MPIU also conducts random studies of provider payment histories to detect billing errors and over-utilization. They perform on-site visits and obtain records to verify that services billed correspond to services rendered to participants. Once services are reviewed, issues may be resolved by provider education or policy revision, recovery of funds from the provider, and/or assessment of civil monetary penalties. In more serious cases, the Department can take any or all of the following actions: • Suspend payment pending further investigation; • Terminate provider numbers; • Exclude entities/individuals; • Refer individuals/providers for criminal prosecution. If you believe that a particular Medicaid provider is abusing the program, you may contact: Medicaid Program Integrity Unit PO Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720-0036 prvfraud@dhw.idaho.gov Phone 1 (208) 334-5754 Fax 1 (208) 334-2026 https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/report-provider-fraud July 1, 2025 Page 26 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 3.2. Self-Reporting Overpayments Providers aware of an overpayment by the Department must immediately repay the improper amount. If an overpayment is identified within the time frame allowed for a claim adjustment, providers should adjust their claims per the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. If the overpayment is identified after the allowed adjustment period, providers can submit the Overpayment Form to Gainwell Technologies for claim adjustments. Providers who want to self-report overpayments and send a lump sum payment or enter into a repayment agreement to pay back the overpayment over time, should fill out and submit the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit’s online Health Care Provider Self Report form. Providers who submit the online Health Care Provider Self-Report forms are contacted by the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit within five (5) working days to discuss repayment. Incentives are extended to providers who responsibly self-report including: • Extended repayment terms; • Waiver of civil monetary penalties; o Civil monetary penalties cannot be waived for background check compliance cases, but an audit would not include all employees; and • Quick resolution of overpayments. Situations that could cause an overpayment include, but are not limited to: • Incorrect coding or billing; • Services provided by an unlicensed or excluded individual; and • Claims submitted for services that were billed but not provided. 3.2.1.

Prevention Requirements Providers are responsible to establish, disseminate, and enforce written policies that detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse to their employees, contractors, and subcontractors. The provider’s employee handbooks must include references to the laws in the written policies, protections for whistleblowers, and specific discussion of policies and procedures in compliance with the False Claims Act of 1863 and Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. These handbooks must be available to all employees, contractors, and agents. Additionally, entities receiving payments totaling $5,000,000 or more per year must provide the Department with an annual written affidavit attesting to their compliance with these laws. Each year the Division of Medicaid sends reminder letters to entities determined to meet this requirement. Compliance with these laws is a condition of payment. Failure to comply results in termination of the provider contract, and potential recoupment and penalties. Providers are encouraged to use the Office of Inspector General’s Compliance Resource Portal for best practices and complimentary trainings. 3.3.1. References: Prevention Requirements a)",

July 1, 2025 Page 29 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 3.4. Payment Error Rate Measurement Audits The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program to measure improper payments in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by reviewing claim payments and participant eligibility determinations every three (3) years. CMS uses a Review Contractor (RC) to perform medical records collection, statistical calculations, medical data, and a processing review of fee-for-service (FFS) claims. The RC selects a sample of claims and calls affected providers to explain the process to establish a point of contact for the audit. The RC then sends each provider a written request by fax or mail detailing the documents needed. Documentation must be submitted per the RC’s instructions including the PERM coversheet and within seventy-five (75) calendar days. If the documentation submitted is insufficient to support the claim, additional documentation is requested. Providers only have fourteen (14) days to comply with any additional requests. It is important that providers cooperate by submitting all requested documentation within the designated timeframe. Failure to provide the requested documentation in the designated time frame is a violation of Idaho Code Section 56-209h and the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, which may result in disenrollment, investigation, recoupment and/or civil monetary penalties. Medical staff and certified coders review the claims and documentation provided to the RC ensuring payment was appropriate based on the Department’s policy, state and federal regulations. Non-compliant claims are recouped by the Department, and to avoid future issues, the provider may be required to submit a corrective action plan. Additionally, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit or the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit may investigate providers suspected of fraud or abuse. Providers are still entitled to their normal appeal rights with the Department. The Department monitors PERM audits and follows up with providers and the RC as necessary. This includes reviewing audit results and providing the RC additional information when findings are incorrect. Providers may email their State PERM contact at permaudit@dhw.idaho.gov or CMS at PERMProviders@cms.hhs.gov for any provider specific questions. 3.4.1.

Providers may appeal a finding on a retrospective review by Medicaid or its designee by requesting a reconsideration. If the provider disagrees with the result of the reconsideration, they may file a formal appeal. 3.5.1. Reconsideration Request Prepare a written Request for Reconsideration including additional documentation to support the validity of your claim. Documentation may include medical records, guidance from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Idaho Provider Handbooks, Idaho statute, or Idaho Administrative Procedure Acts (IDAPA). Resubmit to the reviewing agent within 28 days from the mailing date of the Notice of Decision. Upon completion of the reconsideration review, Medicaid will issue a second Notice of Decision. If the provider or participant disagrees with the reconsideration decision made by Medicaid or its designee, they may file a Request for Appeal. The provider or participant has 28 days from the mailing date of the second Notice of Decision to submit a formal appeal. 3.5.2. Appeal Request A formal appeal must be submitted in writing with supporting documentation within 28 days of the date of the Medicaid Review of Claim Determination to: Division of Medicaid Idaho Department of Health and Welfare P.O.

July 1, 2025 Page 32 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 3.6. Services for Immediate Family or Household Member The Department reimburses providers based on the lesser of reasonable costs or customary charges for services and items. The definition for customary charges includes the provision for Medicare rates, which considers items and services furnished to an immediate family or household member to be without charge or no charge due to the relationship between the participant and the provider. Unless otherwise stated providers cannot be reimbursed for services provided to a participant within their immediate family or household. For physicians and non-physician practitioners this also includes services that are incidental to their care. This section does not apply to a non-professional corporation regardless of the relationship with any employee, stockholder, officer or director. It does apply to a professional corporation, which is any corporation owned by healthcare professionals for the purpose of practicing medicine, midwifery, dentistry, podiatry, optometry, or chiropractic care. Providers are encouraged to consult their professional organization’s stance on these services as many organizations such as the American Medical Association consider the treatment of self or an individual with a close personal relationship in violation of their ethical standards. 3.6.1. Immediate Family Definition An immediate family member is: • A spouse; • A natural, step, in-law, or adopted child; • A natural, step, in-law, or adopted parent; • A person acting in loco parentis; • A natural, step, in-law, or adopted sibling; • A natural, step, in-law, or adopted grandchild; or • A natural, step, in-law, or adopted grandparent. The spouse of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law is not considered an immediate family member. Familial bonds remain in effect in the event of the death of one of the parties. 3.6.2. Household Member Definition A household member is anyone living in the provider’s residence with a relationship based on blood, adoption, marriage, or employment. Roommates and renters are not considered a member of the provider’s household. However, services provided for a roommate or renter are still excluded from reimbursement when they are an immediate family member. 3.6.3.

Prohibition on Gifts to Participants Providers are prohibited from offering gifts or incentives to participants and may be liable for a civil monetary penalty up to $10,000 per occurrence as well as exclusion from Federal programs for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. This includes waivers of co-payments and the transfer of items or services for free or below the fair market value. There are some allowances such as: • Nominal gifts other than cash and valued up to $15 per item, but not more than $75 annually; • Items or services offered on equal terms to the general public, regardless of insurance status; • Payments between an employer and employee; • Waivers of cost-sharing payments not advertised and based on financial need; • Incentives to promote the delivery of preventive care services to any participant, or services in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF); • Drug manufacturers that do not file claims with Medicaid; and • Independent provider funded entities furnishing services to the financially needy that do not require participants receive services from a particular provider. 3.7.1.

Idaho Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) is the interactive voice response system (IVR) that allows a computer to recognize voice and telephone keypad inputs. MACS will allow users to access a database via a telephone touchtone keypad or by speech recognition, after which they can service their own inquiries by following the instructions. MACS will respond with pre- recorded audio to further direct users on how to proceed. MACS can be used to control almost any function where the system can be broken down into a series of simple menu choices. The following table shows the information available through MACS.

Benefit Eligibility Checks Providers must verify and document participant eligibility and Healthy Connections enrollment status on the date of service and prior to rendering services to qualify for reimbursement. More information about checking participant eligibility is in the Verifying Participant Eligibility section of the handbook. Gainwell Technologies provides the ability for providers to verify billing code coverage as well. Due to system limitations, the system shows all codes residing in a single benefit category. It does not show benefits specific to the participant. Gainwell does try to name the benefits that apply to a particular age group. Providers should be aware of this system limitation when determining whether a participant is eligible for a service. Furthermore, providers must abide by the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. When a limitation is stated in the handbook, the provider is responsible for ensuring they do not exceed that limitation regardless of the system check. 4.2.1.

A complete application includes a Medicaid Provider Agreement and a W-9, which must be signed by the provider and submitted with the enrollment application along with other attachments to Gainwell Technologies through their website. The date of enrollment is considered the date a complete application is submitted. Enrollment can be backdated up to a year from the date of application in some circumstances. Individual providers enrolling must disclose information, including, but not limited to: • Date of birth (DOB); • Social Security Number (SSN); • Licensure; • National Provider Identifier (if applicable); and • Convictions of any criminal offense related to the person’s involvement in any program under Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP since those programs began.

A disclosing entity is defined as “a Medicaid provider (other than an individual practitioner or group of practitioners), or a fiscal agent.” Both individuals and entities must disclose family relationships between persons with ownership or control interests in the disclosing entity. Disclosing entities must also disclose: • Names and addresses of any person with an ownership or control interest in the disclosing entity; • Names, addresses, DOBs, and SSNs of any managing employee or fiscal agent of the disclosing entity; • Whether a person with an ownership interest is related to another person with an ownership or control interest; • Names of other disclosing entities in which the owner, managing employee or fiscal agent has ownership or control interest regardless of the percentage of ownership; • Convictions of persons who have ownership or control interests in the provider entity; • Convictions of persons who are managing employees or fiscal agents of the provider entity; and • Whether any person with an ownership or control interest, a managing employee or a fiscal agent has voluntarily revoked, terminated or been subject to a revocation or termination action of a Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP enrollment as defined by 42 CFR 455.107.

Crossover Only Providers Healthcare professionals and facilities that do not wish to be Medicaid providers can instead choose to enroll as crossover only providers to receive coinsurance and deductible payments for participants dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Enrollment as a crossover only provider also allows the professional to be an Ordering, Referring and Prescribing Providers when they meet all other requirements. This enrollment option is not for providers wanting to submit claims to Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for non-Medicare services or participants with Medicaid only. Providers wishing to enroll as a crossover only provider must complete an enrollment application with their Medicare certification, sign the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, and retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of medical necessity. This enrollment is for professional services only. If an enrolled provider later chooses to start billing Idaho Medicaid for these services, they can contact Provider Enrollment for instructions on converting their account. See General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information about reimbursement for participants dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. 5.2.1. Mental Health Clinics Idaho Medicaid’s behavioral health and substance use disorder services are usually covered under the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan (IBHP) with benefits administered under contract by Magellan Healthcare, Inc. However, participants with only Medicare Savings Plan eligibility or dual eligible participants enrolled in the Idaho Medicaid Plus or Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP), do not receive benefits under the IBHP. Mental Health Clinics providing services to these participants when eligible are reimbursed through Fee-For-Service Medicaid or under the dual health plan in which they are enrolled. The clinic must enroll as a crossover only provider with a group NPI or service location with all Medicare certified staff as rendering providers (e.g. Licensed Clinical Social Workers). July 1, 2025 Page 49 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 5.3. Managed Care Organization/Ordering, Referring and Prescribing Providers Healthcare professionals and facilities providing services to a Medicaid managed care organization are required to enroll with Idaho Medicaid. Providers that do not wish to be fee- for-service Medicaid providers can instead choose to enroll as non-billing entities. This enrollment also allows for the provider to order, refer, or prescribe services and items, allowing participants enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid to fill prescriptions or another Idaho Medicaid provider to accept a referral. Providers wishing to enroll as managed care organization/non-billing ordering, referring and prescribing (MCO/ORP) providers must complete an enrollment application, sign the MCO/ORP Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, and retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of medical necessity. The Department has established a streamlined process to enroll non-billing individuals. This enrollment method is not for providers who want to submit claims directly to Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for their services. If an enrolled non-billing provider later chooses to start billing fee-for-service Idaho Medicaid, they can contact Provider Enrollment for instructions on converting their account. July 1, 2025 Page 50 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers Non-billing Ordering, Referring and Prescribing 5.4. Providers Healthcare professionals that do not wish to be Medicaid providers can instead choose to enroll as non-billing entities for the sole purpose of ordering, referring, or prescribing services and items. This allows participants to fill prescriptions or an Idaho Medicaid provider to accept a referral. Providers wishing to enroll as non-billing ordering, referring and prescribing providers must complete an enrollment application, sign the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, and retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of medical necessity. The Department established a streamlined process to enroll non-billing individuals whose only relationship with the Idaho Medicaid program is to refer for specialized care or order items or services. This enrollment is for individuals only, not facilities or provider group entities. Call Idaho Medicaid Provider Enrollment toll free at 1 (866) 686-4272 for a non-billing provider enrollment form. This enrollment method is not for individuals who want to submit claims to Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for their services.

July 1, 2025 Page 51 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 5.5. Medicaid Provider Identification Numbers 5.5.1. Individual Provider Numbers The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a requirement of HIPAA. The NPI must be used on all electronic claims and identifies healthcare providers to health plans with a unique 10-digit numeric provider identifier. An NPI can only be associated to one Tax ID, but a Tax ID can be associated to many NPI numbers or Idaho Medicaid Provider numbers. Providers who registered in the MMIS with an NPI will use that NPI on all paper or electronic transactions. Reimbursement for providers with an NPI is sent to the pay-to address associated with the NPI. Providers without an NPI can apply for one online at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/#/ or by calling 1 (800) 465-3203 for a paper application. Provider-types that do not meet the HIPAA definition of a healthcare provider are considered atypical provider types. Atypical providers are generally not eligible to receive an NPI. Instead a unique 8-digit Idaho Medicaid Provider Number is assigned during enrollment. Claim reimbursement is sent to the pay-to address associated with the Medicaid provider number. The types of providers Idaho Medicaid recognizes as atypical provider types are listed below: • Adult day health facility; • Behavior consultation/crisis management; • Certified family homes; • Chore service providers; • Community support workers; • Home delivered meal providers; • Home modification contractors; • Non-medical transportation agency and individual providers; • Non-emergency and/or non-medical commercial transportation; • Personal Assistance Agency (PCS/aged and disabled (A&D) agency); • Personal Care Services (PCS) Family Alternate Care Home (FACH); • Personal emergency response system (PERS) providers; • Residential Assisted Living Facility (RALF); • Residential habilitation agency; • Respite care providers; • Self-determination fiscal employer agent; • Supported employment agency; • Transition mangers; and • Transportation providers. 5.5.2. Multiple Service Locations Providers with multiple service locations must identify where the service took place. A service location is considered separate from the primary location when one of the following applies: • The location is off-campus from the primary demonstrated by: o The site is not immediately adjacent to the main building. o The site is more than 250 yards from the main building. • The site is on-campus but presents itself separately from the primary location. • The Department determines the site to be a separate service location. When billing claims, providers with multiple service locations must enter a three-digit site number (i.e. 001, 002) to identify the specific location, in addition to their NPI/Medicaid ID. The three-digit location code is identified on the provider enrollment approval letter. Providers can also obtain this number by logging into their Trading Partner Account to view the information.

Group Practice The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires the identification of the individual who actually performs a service when billing under a group number. The performing provider’s individual NPI/Medicaid provider number must be on the claim as well as the provider’s group NPI/Medicaid number.

July 1, 2025 Page 53 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 5.6. Provider Qualifications Idaho Medicaid providers must meet all qualification requirements to be eligible for payment. Providers are required where appropriate to be licensed, certified, or registered with the appropriate state and federal authorities. Continued provider participation is contingent on the ongoing maintenance of required credentials. The claims processing system verifies the effective dates of the provider’s credentials against the date of service. Provider credentials must be up to date or claims are denied. Providers are required to split claims for covered and non-covered dates of service, or update their credentials with Gainwell Technologies and resubmit the claim. The loss of, or failure to renew, required credentials or insurance is cause to terminate a provider’s participation in the Idaho Medicaid Program. Providers are also required to carry any insurance mandated by state or federal regulations, or Idaho Medicaid. Additional provider qualifications are listed throughout the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook based on provider type or service requirements. Payment of a claim does not verify that a provider meets qualifications to provide the service. It is the provider’s responsibility to ensure they meet the qualifications for a service. Providers that do not meet the qualifications for a paid service may be subject to recoupment and civil or monetary penalties. 5.6.1.

Ownership and Controlling Interests Providers with any type of partnership, corporation or nonprofit entity with an executed Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Provider Agreement agree that the entity and the partners, directors, officers, members, or individuals with an ownership interest of five- percent (5%) or greater, are jointly and severally liable for any breach of this Provider Agreement, and that action by the Department against the Provider may result in action against all such individuals in the entity. The agreement also stipulates that providers furnish the Department or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, within thirty-five (35) days of the request, full and complete information related to certain business transactions, specifically about: • The ownership of any subcontractor with whom the provider has had business transactions totaling more than $25,000 during the 12-month period ending on the date of the request; and • Any significant business transactions between the provider and any wholly owned supplier, or between the provider and any subcontractor, during the 5-year period ending on the date of the request. Providers are also required in their Provider Agreement to comply with the disclosure of ownership requirements in 42 CFR Part 455, Subpart B, and 42 CFR 411.361, when as applicable, and to notify the Department thirty (30) days prior to any change of ownership. The Provider Agreement is not transferable to the new owner. July 1, 2025 Page 55 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 5.8. Provider Risk Levels Medicaid agencies must assign a categorical risk level for each provider type enrolling in the program. The screening level determines the processes the state must use for enrollment of new providers and revalidation of existing providers. Whenever appropriate, states are required to use the same risk level assigned by Medicare or assign a higher risk level. The screening requirements listed below are in addition to all other provider enrollment requirements already established. Screening Required by the Affordable Care Act by Provider Risk Level Type of Screening Required Limited Moderate High Verification of any provider/supplier-specific requirements established by Medicare X X X Conduct license verifications (may include licensure checks across States) X X X Database Checks (to verify Social Security Number (SSN), the National Provider Identifier (NPI), the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) licensure, an OIG exclusion; taxpayer identification number; tax delinquency; death of individual practitioner, owner, authorized official, delegated official, or supervising physician) X X X Pre and post enrollment Site Visits (Unscheduled/Unannounced) X X Background Checks with fingerprinting X 5.8.1.

Maintenance of Information Providers shall notify the Department of any changes to the information contained in the Enrollment Application, including but not limited to their mailing address and service locations, within 30 days of the date of the change. The Department is required by Federal regulations to terminate a provider’s enrollment for failure to submit timely and correct information, which may also affect the provider’s enrollment in other states’ Medicaid programs. The Department may allow a provider to keep their enrollment if it documents in writing that termination would not be in the best interests of the Medicaid program. Failure to keep information current may also result in recoupment and civil or monetary penalties. After enrolling, any updates needed to the provider file can be done through the online portal at the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. Once logged into your Trading Partner Account (TPA), select the Provider Enrollment Application link to electronically maintain your provider record. Provider record changes include, but are not limited to: • Change in address • New phone number • Name change (individual, group practice, etc.) • Change in ownership or tax identification information • Change in provider status (voluntary inactive, retired, etc.) • Add/update/end date of rendering provider • Add/update/end date of service locations All correspondence sent to the provider’s mailing address on file with the State’s fiscal agent is deemed to be received by the Provider. Department correspondence is not forwarded by a change of address with the U.S. Postal Service. All mail and checks are returned to Gainwell Technologies.

Change in Ownership or Tax Identification Information Please be advised that a change in ownership or tax identification information requires a NEW provider enrollment application. The Idaho Medicaid provider agreement IS NOT transferable. Notification of a change must be made to the Department timely, within 35- days. The following are examples of changes of ownership. This list is not exhaustive. In all the examples below, a new provider enrollment IS required and the existing record must be termed. Providers who are unsure of whether a transaction constitutes a change of ownership should contact the Division of Medicaid. Examples include: 1. The provider is purchased or leased by another organization resulting in the transfer of the provider’s identification number. 2. Changes to type of organization (e.g. Partnerships to limited liability company, or sole proprietorship to organization), which result in an asset or liability change. 3. An acquisition or merger where one entity purchases another. The purchasing entity typically uses their provider number in place of the selling provider’s. 4. Consolidations, when a new corporate entity is formed, and the merging companies are non-surviving. 5. Changes in composition of a partnership (i.e. removal, addition, or substitution of one or more individuals as partners). 6. Transfers, creations or changes in the control of government owned institutions between different levels of government, such as city to county, state to county, etc.. 7. 8. Transfer of title or property to another party. Leasing of all or part of a provider facility. 9. Bankruptcy proceedings filing. 10. Changes to a facility that require a change in licensure or certification. Providers are not required to get a new NPI after a change in ownership, however, providers are encouraged to do so. This allows for a smooth billing transition and tracking of receivables, along with avoiding NPI crosswalk issues. 5.11.1.

Participant Eligibility and Benefit Plan Coverage Medicaid is a medical assistance program that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments to assist in providing medical care to individuals. Applicants must meet each of the financial and non-financial requirements of a program to participate in its benefit plan, which may include a review of income, resources and other assets. The Division of Self- Reliance determines Medicaid eligibility and enrolls eligible applicants in the appropriate benefit package. General information for participants on services covered under the Idaho Medicaid Program are listed in the booklet, Idaho Health Plan, which is available in English and Spanish from the Division of Medicaid, Department Regional Offices, or online. All services fall under either the Medicaid Basic Plan or Medicaid Enhanced Plan. However, some participants’ eligibility to receive those services may provide additional restrictions, limitations or benefits not otherwise available as described below. See the Provider Handbooks under Provider Guidelines for specific service coverage and billing details for individual programs and specialties. 6.1.

Medicaid Identification Card An identification card is issued to participants determined eligible for Medicaid benefits. All Medicaid participants, except otherwise ineligible non-citizens or presumptive eligibility (PE) participants, receive an identification card. Possession of a Medicaid ID card does not guarantee Medicaid eligibility or provider payment. Providers should request the Medicaid ID card with additional picture identification and retain copies of this documentation for their records. The participant’s Medicaid identification (MID) number is on the card. Cards issued after June 1, 2010 are a 10-digit number with no letters or symbols. Cards issued prior to June 1, 2010 are seven digits. Providers should convert the older versions by adding three zeroes on the front of the MID number. Participants enrolled in the Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) plan or Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) are issued an alternative Medicaid card by their chosen or assigned health plan.

Medicaid only reimburses for services rendered to participants eligible for Medicaid benefits at the time of service. Deceased participants are not eligible for services or items. Providers are not reimbursed for services or items provided after the participant’s date of death. Example A participant is eligible and has Medicaid coverage during the months of April and June. The participant was found ineligible and didn’t have coverage during May. Eligibility information can be accessed three (3) different ways: • Trading Partner Account (TPA) on Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website; • MACS 1 (866) 686-4272; or • HIPAA compliant vendor software (tested with Gainwell Technologies). To obtain eligibility information from one of these systems, submit two (2) participant identifiers from the following list: • MID number; • Social Security number (SSN); • Last name, first name; or • Date of birth. Available participant eligibility information includes eligibility dates and Healthy Connections (HC) enrollment data, Medicaid special program limitations, certain service limitations, procedure code inquiries, third party recovery (TPR), Medicare coverage information, co- payments, and lock-in data. When viewing participant eligibility on a trading partner account Healthy Connections information is listed on the “Network” tab. If no information is available, then the participant is not enrolled with Healthy Connections, and a referral for services is not required. 6.3.1.

Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) Providers can use MACS to check participant eligibility. Eligibility information is available on: • Healthy Connections Program; • Eligibility with special programs; • Service limits; • Prior authorization (PA); • Co-payments; and • Other health coverage. MACS informs providers of the type of Medicaid benefits a participant is eligible for on the dates of service. More information about MACS is found in the Idaho Medicaid Automated Customer Service (Idaho MACS) section of this handbook. Participants eligible for the full range of Medicaid services have their benefit plans communicated as eligible for Medicaid benefits. Participants, such as those on hospice, who are not eligible for the full range of Medicaid services have their restrictions reported according to their benefit plan. Example A participant eligible for the Medicaid Basic Plan has their eligibility communicated as eligible for basic Medicaid benefits, and only benefits restricted to the basic plan are communicated. The benefit plan parameters for Presumptive Eligibility (PE), Lock-in, and Co-pay remain unchanged and any restrictions or requirements for participants are communicated accordingly. 6.3.3. Trading Partner Account (TPA) Information regarding online billing and eligibility verification can be found in the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide. When verifying eligibility, the following information is provided for participants enrolled in Healthy Connections: • Network of HC clinic: o Healthy Connections; o Healthy Connections Care Management; o Healthy Connections Medical Home; and o Exempt from Healthy Connections. • Demographics of the HC clinic: o Name of HC clinic; o Address of HC clinic; o Phone number of HC clinic; and o Hours of operation of HC clinic. 6.3.4. Vendor Supplied Software Providers may contract with a software vendor and use software supplied by the vendor. Software specifications can be found on the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website by selecting Companion Guides under the Reference Material menu. The specifications assist the vendor in duplicating the program requirements and allows providers to obtain the same information available as the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. All vendor software must successfully test transactions with Gainwell Technologies before use. Providers can check eligibility using vendor software, if the software is modified to meet the July 1, 2025 Page 67 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers requirements of the HIPAA ASC X12 270/271, version 5010 format, and if the vendor successfully tests the transactions with Gainwell Technologies. a) Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) Software Providers required to submit EVV data through the Sandata EVV Aggregator may contract with any EVV software vendor of their choice as long as the software is certified as compatible by Sandata.

Participant Program Abuse/Lock-In Program Medicaid reviews participant utilization to determine if services are being used at a frequency or amount that may be delivered at a level harmful to the participant and to identify services that are not medically necessary. Abuse can include frequent use of emergency room facilities for non-emergent conditions, frequent use of multiple controlled substances, use of multiple prescribing physicians and/or pharmacies, excessive provider visits, overlapping prescription drugs in the same drug class, and drug seeking behavior as identified by a medical professional. To prevent abuse, Medicaid has implemented the participant lock-in program. Participants identified as abusing or over-utilizing the program may be limited to emergency services only, or the use of one physician/provider and one pharmacy. Services outside of documented emergencies by other providers will not be reimbursed. This prevents these participants from going from doctor to doctor, or from pharmacy to pharmacy, to obtain excessive services. Participants entered in the Lock-in program will be notified by the Department in writing and have thirty-five (35) days to designate a physician/provider and pharmacy or twenty-eight (28) days to file an appeal. If a participant does not make a selection or file an appeal, they will be restricted to services for documented emergencies only and may be suspended from receiving Medicaid if abuse continues. If a provider suspects a Medicaid participant is demonstrating utilization patterns, which may be considered abusive, not medically necessary, potentially endangering the participant’s health and safety, or drug seeking behavior in obtaining prescription drugs, they should notify Medicaid of their concerns. Medicaid will review the participant’s medical history to determine whether the participant is a candidate for the lock-in program. 6.4.1.

Primary Care Physician The primary care physician (PCP) for lock-in participants is responsible for coordination of routine medical care and making referrals to specialists as necessary. The PCP educates the lock-in participant on procedures to follow when the office is closed, or there is an urgent or emergency situation. This coordination of care and the participant’s knowledge of office procedures should help reduce non-emergent use of the emergency room. If the participant needs to see a physician other than the PCP, the PCP gives the participant a referral to another physician or clinic to ensure payment. See the Referrals section for more information. If a PCP no longer wishes to provide services to the lock-in participant, the PCP must send a written notice to the participant stating the reasons for dismissal with a copy of the letter sent to the Healthy Connections Representative for that region. 6.4.3.

Idaho Medicaid State Plans Idaho Medicaid offers three (3) State Plan benefit packages for participants based on various eligibility criteria. 6.5.1. Medicaid Basic Plan The Medicaid Basic Plan is designed to achieve and maintain participant wellness by emphasizing prevention and proactively managing health. It is the default plan for Medicaid participants. Under some circumstances, participants in the Medicaid Basic Plan with a medical necessity for enhanced services may be eligible for enrollment in the Medicaid Enhanced Plan. This determination is made jointly by Self Reliance in the Division of Welfare and the appropriate bureau in the Division of Medicaid. 6.5.2. Medicaid Enhanced Plan The Medicaid Enhanced Plan includes all of the benefits found in the Medicaid Basic Plan, and additional benefits designed to cover needs of participants with disabilities and/or other special healthcare needs. Participants enrolled in this plan are eligible for the full range of Medicaid covered services. 6.5.3. Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) The MMCP includes all of the benefits found in the Medicaid Basic Plan and the Medicaid Enhanced Plan. Participants enrolled in this plan are eligible for the full range of Medicaid covered services in coordination with their Medicare covered benefits. Participants in this plan may receive Medicaid benefits under fee-for-service or may be enrolled in either the Idaho Medicaid Plus or MMCP health plan under a contracted Managed Care Organization (MCO). July 1, 2025 Page 71 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 6.6. Idaho Medicaid Waivers Idaho Medicaid has two (2) home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers to offer additional benefit packages for participants based on level of care needs. The participant must require services due to their disability that impairs their mental or physical function or independence. They must also be capable of being safely and effectively maintained in a non- institutional setting that in the absence of would require residence in an intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) or nursing facility. 6.6.1. Aged and Disabled Waiver Participants on the Medicaid Enhanced Plan and MMCP Plan are eligible for the Aged and Disabled (A&D) Waiver when they meet nursing facility level of care as determined by the Bureau of Long Term Care (BLTC). The waiver provides additional benefits designed to cover the needs of elderly and disabled adult participants to maintain self-sufficiency, individuality, independence, dignity, choice, and privacy in a cost-effective home-like setting. These services are intended to encourage the involvement of natural supports such as family, friends, neighbors, volunteers, religious community, and others. 6.6.2. Developmental Disability Waiver Participants on the Medicaid Enhanced Plan and MMCP Plan are eligible for the Developmental Disability (DD) Waiver. The waiver provides additional benefits designed to cover the needs of participants with disabilities and/or other special healthcare needs. The participant must be eighteen (18) years of age or older and meet the intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) level of care requirements. The participant must have a diagnosis of being intellectually disabled or a condition defined in section 66-402, Idaho Code. A functional assessment, maladaptive behavior or medical condition is used to qualify. July 1, 2025 Page 72 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 6.7. Presumptive Eligibility (PE) Presumptive Eligibility (PE) assists Idaho residents not currently receiving medical assistance from the state or county and who do not have sufficient resources for private medical coverage. PE provides immediate, presumed coverage for qualified candidates. The maximum coverage period is 45 days while the participant applies for full coverage. A Medicaid enrolled hospital with a current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department for PE may provide assistance to individuals completing and submitting applications for health coverage. Staff must receive Department approved training in PE before they can complete an application and make a PE determination. A record of this training must be maintained and available to the Department upon request.

Breast and Cervical Cancer (BCC) Program The Breast and Cervical Cancer (BCC) program allows the state to provide Medicaid benefits to uninsured participants, who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, when they need treatment for breast or cervical cancer, including pre-cancerous conditions and early stage cancer. In order to be eligible, an applicant must be initially screened and diagnosed through a local Women’s Health Check Office (usually the district health department) participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). Medicaid coverage lasts for the duration of their cancer treatment, and ends when a participant’s plan of care reflects a status of surveillance, follow-up or maintenance. Additionally, coverage ends if a participant’s treatment relies on an unproven procedure in lieu of primary or adjuvant treatment methods. The applicant can be presumed eligible as described in Presumptive Eligibility (PE) before a formal Medicaid determination. Although Medicaid resource limits do not apply, the applicant must: • Have an income between 138% and 250% of the federal poverty level; • Be diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the Women’s Health Check Program; • Be at least twenty-one (21) years old and under the age of sixty-five (65); • Have no creditable health insurance (if insured, the plan does not cover the same type of cancer); • Be an Idaho resident; • Be a U.S. citizen or meet requirements for legal noncitizen; • Not reside in an ineligible institution; and • Not be fleeing prosecution of a felony, custody, or confinement of a felony conviction or violating a condition of probation or parole. 6.8.1.

July 1, 2025 Page 75 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 6.9. Early & Periodic Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit was designed to help ensure that all Medicaid-eligible participants under the age of twenty-one (21) receive preventive health care and early intervention services needed to maximize each participant’s potential for healthy growth and development. The benefit allows participants to receive additional services not typically covered for adults and increase access to services with limitations on amount, duration, frequency and location (e.g., hourly and/or location limits on Personal Care Services). Services not typically allowed due to duplication, overlap and/or multiple services at the same time and/or date of service may be considered when the services are medically necessary. Idaho Medicaid does not have an expenditure cap or wait list for services covered under EPSDT, however, providers may have a waitlist for appointments or scheduling procedures. Providers of EPSDT services have all of the same requirements as other providers of their type and specialty. Services can only be covered under EPSDT when the service is: • Determined to be medical in nature; • Safe, effective and generally recognized as an accepted method of medical practice or treatment; • Not determined to be experimental, investigational or cosmetic in nature; • Under a category of service listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act; • Medically necessary to correct or ameliorate (needed to sustain or support) an illness or a health condition; • For an illness or health condition diagnosed by a physician, therapist, or other licensed practitioner operating within the scope of their licensure; • Supported as medically necessary by the utilization of other services to treat the illness or health condition; and • Represented by an appropriate diagnosis and CPT® or HCPCS code. All claims for services approved under EPSDT must have the EP modifier on the claim line. 6.9.1. EPSDT and Waiver Services Adult participants under the age of twenty-one (21) on a waiver have the same access to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services as a non-waiver participant. Some waiver services are covered under the State Plan for these participants with increased access under EPSDT as described in the service description on the waiver. Services are considered for coverage under both EPSDT and their waiver when authorized by the Department. Support type services are not covered under EPSDT as they fail to meet the requirement for a 1905(a) service. Any service provided under EPSDT will not impact a participant’s budget or share of cost. 6.9.2. EPSDT Request Procedure See the subsection below for the request procedure for services under State Plan, outside of State Plan, outpatient behavioral health and dental services. The parent, guardian or participant receives a Notice of Decision from the Department or their designee informing them whether the request was approved or denied. The Notice of Decision may also list alternative services that are available. If the request is denied, the parent, guardian or participant, if over eighteen (18), may appeal the decision. Instructions for appeals are on the Notice of Decision. July 1, 2025 Page 76 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers a) Request Procedure: Services Under State Plan Services that require a prior authorization are considered under Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) during the prior authorization process. However, if a service does not usually require a prior authorization, a request can be submitted with a note on the coversheet requesting a review under EPSDT and the reason for the request (e.g., for not meeting criteria, over limitations, etc.). Prior authorization requests without a legitimate cause are returned unreviewed. Services covered under the State Plan should be requested through the service’s normal request channel with all regularly required documentation (e.g., durable medical equipment through the Medical Care Unit). Requests are usually completed in fifteen (15) business days or less. b) Request Procedure: Services Not in State Plan When a participant requires services not covered under the State Plan, an EPSDT Request Form must be submitted to the Department for prior authorization.

All services under Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) must fall into a category of service listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, be considered safe, effective, and meet acceptable standards of medical practice. The EPSDT Request Form must be completed and signed by a competent participant over age eighteen (18) or by their parent or guardian. All requests must be submitted with supporting documentation and an order from a physician or non-physician practitioner which may require coordination with other providers to obtain. Services not under State Plan may take longer to review when: • A new provider must be secured to perform the treatment; • Additional documentation is needed to determine medical necessity; • Providers fail to submit requested materials in a timely manner; • Research is necessary to determine impacts to care; or • The case is particularly complex and requires coordination between multiple agencies and providers to guarantee appropriate care. For other questions, or general information, please email requests to EPSDTrequest@dhw.idaho.gov. c) Request Procedure: Outpatient Behavioral Health Community-based mental health services are provided under the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan by Magellan Healthcare Inc’s provider network. Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) requests for community-based mental health services must be completed on the Magellan Healthcare Inc’s Idaho EPSDT Form. For more information contact Magellan Healthcare, Inc. by calling 1-855-202-0973 or visit the Magellan website. d) Request Procedure: Dental Services Preventive and restorative dental services are provided under the Idaho Smiles plan by Managed Care of North America’s (MCNA) provider network. Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) requests for dental services must be designated on the MCNA prior authorization form. For more information or the prior authorization form contact Idaho Smiles by calling 1-855-233-6262 or visit MCNA Dental’s website.

Incarcerated Persons Medicaid reimbursement is not available for inmates of government jails, tribal jails or prison facilities, unless the inmate, the medical institution and the services rendered meet all the provisions for reimbursement as provided within the “Reimbursement Policy Change for Individuals who are Incarcerated (Residents) of Correctional Facilities (Public Institutions) within Idaho”. Inmates of a public institution operated under the authority of the State of Idaho, or its political subdivision, may be eligible for select Medicaid benefits in a hospital, freestanding psychiatric hospital, or institution for mental disease enrolled with Idaho Medicaid and open to the public. Inmates must otherwise be eligible for Medicaid and have an inpatient status of a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. Healthcare services provided to residents of Idaho eligible for Idaho Medicaid and who are residing in Public Institutions outside of the territorial boundaries of the State of Idaho are excluded from reimbursement under this policy and are the responsibility of the Public Institution with",

Inmates must otherwise be eligible for Medicaid and have an inpatient status of a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. Healthcare services provided to residents of Idaho eligible for Idaho Medicaid and who are residing in Public Institutions outside of the territorial boundaries of the State of Idaho are excluded from reimbursement under this policy and are the responsibility of the Public Institution with authority over that individual. When all provisions are met, the applicant’s incarceration status no longer disqualifies providers from receiving Medicaid reimbursement. Applicants without Medicaid may be evaluated for eligibility as if they were not incarcerated. Providers should come to an agreement with the Public Institution responsible for the individual to determine which entity will apply for Medicaid on the applicant’s behalf when they meet these requirements. Eligibility for incarcerated participants is available retroactively. Medicaid coverage begins the day the inmate is admitted into the medical institution and ends the day of discharge. However, incarcerated participants do not have the same benefits as other participants. Only these services are covered for inmates, and only when all other Idaho Medicaid requirements for the service are fulfilled: • Inpatient room and board; • Ancillary services directly related to the inpatient stay; and • Emergency transportation services for transfers occurring after inpatient status has been determined and only when directly between hospitals, freestanding psychiatric hospitals and institutions for mental diseases providing continued inpatient treatment. 6.10.1. Incarcerated Persons: Third-Party Liability In addition to all regular third-party liability requirements in the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, healthcare services related to the negligent acts of a third- party, including correctional institutions or law enforcement agencies, are their responsibility. Non-covered and excluded services are the responsibility of the Public Institution with custody of the inmate. This includes any service not mentioned in the section above and expenses related to law enforcement personnel or security. 6.10.2.

Katie Beckett Medicaid Eligibility Katie Beckett Medicaid, also known as Home Care for Certain Disabled Children (HCCDC), enables children under the age of nineteen (19) with special health care needs and/or disabilities to receive care at home instead of in an institution. Eligibility for Medicaid is based on the disabled child’s income and assets excluding the income of their parents or guardians. The cost of care at home is compared to the cost of institutionalization when determining eligibility. Once approved for Medicaid, participants are eligible to receive all the benefits on the Enhanced Plan. In the event that a participant becomes institutionalized, the family should contact Self Reliance to update their eligibility. Katie Beckett participants are subject to copayments and premiums as these are based on the household’s income, which is above 133% of the federal poverty limit (FPL). Participants with a household income under 133% are eligible for other Medicaid eligibility. 6.11.1.",

Managed Care Programs for Dual Eligible Participants The Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) plan and Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) are managed care service delivery program options for dual eligible participants. The purpose of these plans is to integrate care for individuals who are currently served by both Medicare and Medicaid and meet certain eligibility requirements. These programs are designed to coordinate delivery of primary, preventive, acute, behavioral, and long-term care services and supports. Participants continue to use their Medicaid ID (MID) numbers as established under the Participant Eligibility and Benefit Plan Coverage section. Participating Medicare Advantage Plans offering MMCP programs also issue a plan identification number specific to their company and a provide participants an identification card incorporating their Medicare and Medicaid benefits. 6.12.1. Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) Participants who are 21 years old or older, enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B, eligible for full Medicaid, who reside in an IMPlus coverage area, who do not voluntarily enroll in MMCP, and who are not in an excluded or exempt population are required to enroll in IMPlus. Participants who do not make an active selection of a health plan to administer their IMPlus coverage are automatically enrolled in IMPlus and auto-assigned to a participating health plan. 6.12.2. Medicare-Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) Participants who are 21 years old or older, enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, eligible for full Medicaid, and reside in an MMCP coverage area are eligible to voluntarily enroll in MMCP through an MMCP health plan. 6.12.3. Billing Procedures for Managed Care Dual Plan Participants Services with Medicare coverage limits must be billed to the health plan in which the participant is enrolled using their health plan-specific identification number and their Medicare identification number if enrolled under IMPlus: • Hospital services; • Medical services; • Prescription drug services; and • Nursing Home (NH). Medicaid only services must be billed to the health plan in which the participant is enrolled using their health plan-specific identification number: • Behavioral health services; • Aged & Disabled (A&D) Waiver Services; • Personal Care Services (PCS); • Community-Based Rehabilitation Services; and • Transition Management and Transition Services.

July 1, 2025 Page 86 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 6.16. Medicare Savings Program The Department has agreements with the Social Security Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which allows the state to enroll people in the Premium Hospital Insurance Program (also referred to as Premium HI or Medicare Part A) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (also referred to as SMI or Medicare Part B). The agreements allow Medicaid participants entitled to Medicare to have their Part A and/or Part B Medicare premiums paid by Medicaid. Participants do not have to be 65 years old or older to be eligible for Medicare. See the subsections below for the different kinds of Part A and Part B Medicare Savings Programs. See the “Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) Medicare/Medicaid Billing Information” subsection of the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, for more information. 6.16.1. Part A Medicare Savings Programs There are two types of Part A Medicare Savings Programs: • Regular Type Part A; and • Qualified Disabled Working Individual (QDWI) Part A The Regular Type Part A Medicare Savings Program is for individuals not entitled to premium- free Medicare Part A benefits. These individuals must apply for Medicare with the Social Security Administration and be determined eligible for self-pay type Medicare. These individuals have a Medicare claim number with a Beneficiary Identification Code (BIC) of M. This code is found at the end of the Medicare claim number. The Qualified Disabled Working Individual (QDWI) Part A Medicare Savings Program is for individuals that have lost Medicare Part A (HI) entitlement solely because of work and are entitled",

Dually eligible participants receive Medicare Part A and/or Part B premium coverage, and coinsurance and deductible reimbursement consideration for Medicare covered services. Pharmacy items or other services not covered by the dually eligible participant’s Medicare benefits may be covered under the participant’s Medicaid benefits. 6.16.4. Medicare Part D Under the Medicare Modernization Act, dually eligible individuals no longer receive their drug coverage from Medicaid and instead select or are automatically enrolled into private Medicare prescription drug plans. Medicaid may still cover certain essential drugs excluded by law from the Medicare Part D, Prescription Drug Program. Medicare must be billed prior to submitting drug claims to Medicaid. If the Medicare Explanation of Benefits (EOB) indicates that the requested medication is one of the medications not covered by law, then Medicaid may reimburse. 6.16.5.

Otherwise Ineligible Non-citizens Individuals who do not meet the citizenship or qualified non-citizen requirements may be eligible for medical services necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. An emergency medical condition exists when the condition could reasonably be expected to seriously harm the person’s health, cause serious impairment to bodily functions, or cause serious dysfunction to any body part or organ, without immediate medical attention. Childbirth qualifies as an emergency, but ante and postpartum services do not. Medicaid eligibility for otherwise ineligible non-citizens (OINC) begins no earlier than the date the participant experiences the medical emergency and ends the date the emergency condition stops. The Quality Improvement Organization, Telligen, makes determinations on the appropriate length of stay during the eligibility review process. 6.17.1. Applying for Eligibility The general application used to apply for Medicaid is also used for OINC applicants. Applications should be submitted after the emergency condition has ended. Hospitals may attach medical records with applications if they are helping the applicant apply for assistance. Completed applications are submitted to: Self-Reliance Program PO Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0026 The Quality Improvement Organization, Telligen, Inc., determines whether the services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition or qualify as services for pregnant women.",

The Pregnant Women Program The Pregnant Women (PW) program was developed to provide medical assistance to encourage women to seek prenatal care early in a pregnancy and preserve the health of both mother and infant. The program assists Idaho residents with a verified pregnancy not currently receiving medical assistance from the state or county, and without sufficient resources for private medical coverage. Women found eligible under the PW program have the same coverage as participants on the Medicaid Basic Plan. Coverage through the program continues for twelve (12) months after the end of the pregnancy, and extends until the last day of the twelfth (12th) month. Women on the PW program are evaluated for other Medicaid eligibility at the end of their coverage. 6.18.1. Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women Presumptive eligibility (PE) for pregnant women is designed to provide participants prenatal care between being diagnosed pregnant and receiving an eligibility determination. PE for pregnant women only covers outpatient prenatal care and not deliveries, miscarriages, or abortions. Medical coverage for the PW Program during the PE period is restricted to ambulatory outpatient, pregnancy-related services only. Pregnancy-related services may be rendered by any qualified Medicaid provider. Routine prenatal services are covered, as well as some additional services such as nutrition counseling, risk-reduction follow-up, and social service counseling. Providers are not required to bill another insurance resource, if it exists, before billing Medicaid for prenatal services during the PE period. The PE Program does not cover PW inpatient services. Medicaid does not pay for any type of abortion for women on the PE Program. Also, women with PE are not covered for any delivery services. Services not covered under Medicaid are the participant’s responsibility. If the woman with PE has applied for the PW Program or any other Medicaid program, and is determined eligible, hospital inpatient services may be covered. 6.18.2.

Coverage is limited to eight months, beginning when the refugee arrives in the United States. Children born to the refugee during that time period are also eligible for the Refugee Medical Assistance Program, but only as long as their parent’s coverage remains in effect. At the conclusion of the program’s coverage, participants will be evaluated for coverage under other eligibility programs. In order to qualify for Medicaid eligibility through the Refugee Medical Assistance Program, the applicant must: • Meet the federal definition of refugee for the purposes of the program; • Not be otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP; and • Have an income under 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Refugees whose income exceeds 150% of the FPL may still be eligible under a special “spend down” consideration if the remainder of their income after medical expenses are deducted drops their income below 150% of the FPL. Coverage under the Refugee Medical Assistance Program is contingent on Idaho’s receipt of federal funding. In the event that funds are not received, this program will be suspended without advance notice. 6.19.1.

Youth Empowerment Services (YES) The Medicaid Youth Empowerment Services (YES) Program provides a doorway to Medicaid eligibility for children under the age of eighteen (18) with a serious emotional disturbance (SED). Once approved for Medicaid, participants are eligible for all benefits on the Enhanced Plan, plus respite care through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan (IBHP) and person-centered service planning. The participant must complete an assessment and update the person- centered service plan at least every 12 months, and utilize Medicaid-paid respite services through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan to maintain eligibility under the program. In order to qualify for Medicaid eligibility through the Medicaid YES Program, the applicant must: • Have a verified SED and functional impairment; • Have an income under 300% of the federal poverty level (FPL); • Be under the age of eighteen (18); • Be an Idaho resident; • Be a U.S. citizen or meet requirements for legal noncitizen; • Cooperate with obtaining a medical support order for a non-custodial parent unless good cause can be established; • Not reside in an ineligible institution; and • Not be fleeing prosecution of a felony, custody, or confinement of a felony conviction or violating a condition of probation or parole. A serious emotional disturbance is defined as a diagnosable mental health, emotional or behavioral disorder, or a neuropsychiatric condition which results in a serious disability and which causes a functional impairment. The diagnosis must be made in alignment with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). A disability caused by the diagnosis is considered serious if it causes a substantial impairment of thought, perception, affect or behavior in family, school or community settings, and requires sustained treatment interventions. A substance use disorder does not, by itself, constitute a serious emotional disturbance, although it may coexist with serious emotional disturbance. The SED must be verified by Medicaid’s Independent Assessment contractor (Liberty Healthcare) using a Comprehensive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA) and the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) functional assessment tool. Liberty Healthcare completes the CDA and CANS in the applicant’s home and contact them within one business day with the results and next steps. These assessments are provided at no cost to the family or applicant seeking eligibility. A CDA completed by another provider may be used if it was completed in the last six (6) months. Providers can direct potential applicants to contact Liberty Healthcare at 1 (877) 305-3469 for the free assessment. Other services may be available for children with an SED who do not meet the additional requirements for Medicaid eligibility; e.g., family income exceeding 300% FPL. See the Youth Empowerment Services website or contact Magellan Healthcare for more information on getting services for youth without Medicaid. 6.20.1.

Healthy Connections (HC) Healthy Connections (HC) is the Idaho Medicaid primary care program in which a primary care provider or team provides comprehensive and continuous medical care to a participant with the goal of improving health outcomes. Our mission is to ensure Medicaid participants receive the care they need, when they need it, and in the appropriate setting. The Healthy Connections program is structured to incentivize HC providers to transform to the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care whereby a participant’s treatment is coordinated through their primary care provider and their team, which can include organizations, hospitals or other entities. The goals of HC are to: • Ensure access to healthcare; • Improve the quality of healthcare and overall well-being of Medicaid participants; • Emphasize care coordination and continuity of care; • Encourage participants to be involved in their healthcare decisions; and • Achieve cost efficiencies for the Idaho Medicaid Program. Medicaid participant enrollment into HC is required in the majority of counties statewide. Individuals qualifying for Idaho Medicaid will receive correspondence requesting they identify their current Primary Care Provider (PCP) or choose an HC clinic. July 1, 2025 Page 96 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 7.1. Healthy Connections Provider Enrollment Idaho Medicaid primary care providers participate in Healthy Connections by signing a Coordinated Care Provider Agreement in addition to the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement. Coordinated Care Provider Agreements are available from the Regional Healthy Connections Representatives. Addresses and telephone numbers for the regional HC offices are listed in the Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, and at the Manage my Medicaid with Healthy Connections website. What is a primary care provider? An MD, DO, PA, Nurse Practitioner, etc., who participates in the Healthy Connections program with a contracted organization to coordinate and monitor primary care services. What are primary care services? Services including preventive services, diagnosis and treatment of acute injury and sickness, and management of long-term conditions. In the Healthy Connections (HC) Program, Primary Care Providers qualify for tiers and are incentivized to implement a Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care and improve participant outcomes. HC service locations offering enhanced participant care and PCMH characteristics may qualify for higher tier placement. Upon approval of tier placement, the HC service location is issued an HC Coordinated Care Agreement Addendum which outlines requirements to maintain tier status and monthly primary care case management fee. Providers are required to keep their record current and notify Gainwell Technologies of any changes in their record to ensure accurate participant enrollment in Healthy Connections, including: • Enroll all rendering PCPs and each HC service location in the MMIS system for the purposes of assigning participants at the location where they receive primary care services. • Keep all of the provider enrollment information current in the MMIS system by completing any maintenance items within 28 days of the change as required in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement. • Updated provider record information will be acted on once submitted and approved through the provider enrollment",

Healthy Connections Clinic Panel Limit Guidelines The following are the guidelines to determine some of the panel limitations: • Accepting New Medicaid: Clinic must have the capacity for members to establish care within two (2) months of enrollment. If clinic does not have the capacity for members to establish within this timeframe, clinic must set their panel to Not Accepting New Medicaid. o If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, clinic is required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant July 1, 2025 Page 99 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers or providing a one-time referral and working with participant to schedule an appointment. • Accepting Mandatory Assignment: The assignments will occur when the participant doesn’t choose a PCP, and they are within the panel limits (i.e. age limits, etc.). The clinic requirements for assignments are as follows: o When a participant is assigned to clinic, the clinic is required to allow assigned participant(s) to establish care, even if the panel subsequently has closed to accepting mandatory assignments; and o If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, clinic is required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant or providing a one-time referral and work with patient to schedule an appointment. 7.1.4.

Healthy Connections Coordinated Care Agreement and Tier Compliance by Tier In addition to the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, every Healthy Connections clinic/organization, at the Tax ID level, is required to sign an HC Coordinated Care Agreement. Providers may be subject to sanctions for being deemed out of compliance as per the HC Coordinated Care Agreement. HC Staff will conduct periodic reviews of HC organization’s ability to maintain compliance with the HC Coordinated Care Agreement and specific tier requirements. Clinics will be responsible for providing proof of meeting Tier requirements at a minimum annually (unless otherwise specified). As part of this review, HC Staff may ask for documentation that provides proof of meeting specific requirements. Compliance specific information including, but not limited to, the following table: HC Tier Compliance Process Tier Requirement Compliance Frequency Compliance Level Verification I, II & III Provide 24 hour, 7-days a week availability of information, referral and treatment for emergency medical conditions After hours phone call to service location resulting in reaching an after-hours medical professional Annually Service Location I, II & III Affiliate with a Healthy Connections VCO Verified by the Department Annually Organization Tax ID II & III* Outreach to non-engaged patients done annually Proof of communication to non-engaged patients, randomly selected by the Department Annually, at a minimum Organization July 1, 2025 Page 101 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers HC Tier Compliance Process Tier Requirement Compliance Frequency Compliance Level Verification II & III* Patient/family education and self-management support for chronic conditions done annually Examples of educational material given to patients Annually Organization II & III* Quality improvement activities meant to improve 1 or more quality measures.

Healthy Connections Corrective Action Process (CAP) When Idaho Medicaid becomes aware that a clinic is out of compliance for one of the Tier requirements, the corrective action process will begin. If compliance is not met within the timeframe outlined below, the outcome could include one of the following: Regression of tier, Case management suspension, or Termination as a Healthy Connections provider. Corrective action steps: Step One: Clinic will be contacted verbally to discuss the non-compliance and possible solution. Clinic will be given fifteen (15) business days to correct the non-compliance issue. Step Two: At day sixteen (16), if compliance is not met, a formal corrective action letter will be emailed to the clinic contact that has been established at first contact. Clinic will have an additional fifteen (15) business days to correct the non-compliance issue. Step Three: At day thirty-one (31), if compliance is not met, a second formal corrective action letter will be emailed and mailed certified, return receipt. Clinic will have an additional fifteen (15) days to correct the non-compliance issue. Step Four: After the forty-five (45) days have expired: • If non-compliance is for 24/7 requirement, clinic will be termed as a Healthy Connections provider, and a letter will be mailed, certified, return receipt. • If non-compliance is for other Tier requirements, clinic will be regressed to appropriate tier (example Tier 3 to Tier 2). A formal letter will be mailed, certified, return receipt. If regression occurs, clinic can apply for higher Tier once compliance has been met. 7.1.7. Healthy Connections Case Management Payment In addition to payment for services rendered, Healthy Connections (HC) clinics are paid a monthly case management fee. The monthly case management fee is paid for every participant enrolled with the HC clinic on the first day of each month. The case management payment is based on the tier level of the HC clinic as of the first of the month. The case management payment is generally processed on the Tuesday of the first full week of the month. The monthly Healthy Connections roster reports are then available following the processing of the case management payment. HC clinics qualify for one of the following three tiers of reimbursement for all enrolled participants: Healthy Healthy Healthy Connections Connections Medicaid Plan Connections Care Medical Home Tier I Management Tier III Tier II All Enrolled participants $3.00 $7.00 $9.50 7.1.8. Healthy Connections Participant Rosters The following two Primary Care rosters are available to PCPs. July 1, 2025 Page 103 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • An online, dynamic Primary Care Roster is available on the Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website through your Trading Partner Account and is called the PCP Roster. This is a list of currently enrolled HC participants and the PCP is able to verify eligibility or issue a referral from this roster. This roster can be exported to either Excel format or in PDF form. The contact information on the exportable report can be used to contact participants and encourage them to be engaged in their healthcare. o To further support HC providers in coordinating their patient care, the following are some of the fields included on the exportable Excel or PDF list of participants: ▪ Participant name; ▪ Phone Number; ▪ Address; ▪ Head of Household; and ▪ Enrollment Indicator (Mandatory or Voluntary enrollment). • The Monthly Healthy Connections Roster report is a list of participants enrolled to a Healthy Connections service location effective the first day of the month, and includes case management payment information. The report is divided in to four sections: new enrollees, ongoing enrollees, lost eligibility, and dis-enrollees. This serves as the HC Case Management Payment report. This monthly roster is uploaded to the Organization’s secure portal under the File Exchange ‘Reports’ section and is available in",

July 1, 2025 Page 104 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 7.2. Participant Enrollment Medicaid providers should always verify participant eligibility and Healthy Connections (HC) enrollment prior to rendering services, as described in the Verifying Participant Eligibility section. For participants enrolled in Healthy Connections, the PCP information will be provided through the automated and/or online system. If an HC PCP is not indicated, an HC referral is not required. Enrollment in HC is mandatory for most Medicaid participants and required in the majority of counties statewide. Participants not enrolled in HC are mailed an enrollment form and given up to 90 days to inform us of their choice of PCP. When a Medicaid participant does not choose a PCP and they live in a mandatory county, the participant is assigned to an HC PCP. HC clinics are required to absorb any participant enrolled to their clinic even if a specific provider is no longer with that HC clinic. If the clinic does not have the capacity to absorb those participants, they must change their panel to “Not Accepting New Medicaid”. 7.2.1. Voluntary Participant Enrollment in Healthy Connections Participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections (HC) and without an exception, can complete an enrollment form at an HC clinic and fax it to 1 (888) 532-0014 or e-mail to HCCR7@dhw.idaho.gov. Assisting participants to enroll to an HC clinic will help avoid the possibility of assignment to a different HC clinic. 7.2.2. Participant Enrollment Guidelines • Enrollment in HC is mandatory for most Medicaid participants. • Enrollment requests must be submitted by the participant or an authorized representative. • Enrollment to the HC clinic will be effective the date the enrollment request is approved. • Each enrolled participant is sent a written notice listing the name, phone number, and address of their HC clinic. This notice is generated and mailed the day after the participant’s enrollment is entered. • Family participants are not required to choose the same HC clinic. • Medicaid participants may enroll to an HC clinic in one of the following ways. o Preferred method – Enroll online on the Manage my Medicaid with Healthy Connections website, choosing the blue link “Find a Healthy Connections PCP”. o Complete and return an HC Enrollment form received in the mail; o Complete enrollment form at clinic and have it faxed to the Healthy Connections Consolidated Unit at 1 (888) 532-0014; or o Call the HC Consolidated Unit at 1 (888) 528-5861 to enroll over the phone • Clinic is required to absorb any participants enrolled to their clinic even if a specific provider is no longer with the HC clinic. • The HC Network Directory can be found on the Find a Healthy Connections Primary Care Provider website. 7.2.3. Enrollment to clinic with panel limitations Healthy Connections (HC) clinics have the option to request a closed panel and not accept new Medicaid participants or request panel limitations for enrollment. Limited or closed panel clinics may arrange with HC to process enrollments without prior approval when any of the following conditions are met: o Participants are currently established as shown by claims within last 12 months. o Participants have an upcoming scheduled appointment or recent appointment. July 1, 2025 Page 105 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers o Participants with family members currently established. If the above conditions are not met, or the clinic is closed to new Medicaid, participants will be directed to the clinic for enrollment approval. The clinic must contact Healthy Connections with the approval for the participant to be enrolled in one of the following ways: • Enrollment form from the clinic, signed by the participant or their authorized representative. • Phone call from clinic validating enrollment request received from participant. It is the responsibility of the organization to communicate panel limitations to all locations participating in Healthy Connections. 7.2.4. Mandatory Participant Enrollment in Healthy Connections If a primary care provider (PCP)/clinic chooses to accept mandatory assignment participants, the assignments will occur within the panel",

It is the responsibility of the organization to communicate panel limitations to all locations participating in Healthy Connections. 7.2.4. Mandatory Participant Enrollment in Healthy Connections If a primary care provider (PCP)/clinic chooses to accept mandatory assignment participants, the assignments will occur within the panel limits the PCP/clinic has provided to Healthy Connections (HC) (i.e., accepting new Medicaid, age limits, etc.). The requirements for assignments are as follows: • When a participant is assigned to PCP/clinic, the clinic is required to allow assigned participant(s) to establish care, even if the panel subsequently has closed to accepting mandatory assignments; and • If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, PCP/clinic is required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant or providing a one-time referral. • If the clinic cannot absorb patients due to a provider leaving the location, or assigned participants cannot access care timely, the clinic must set their panel limits to “Not Accepting New Medicaid”, and change their panel limits to not accepting mandatory assignments. It is recommended that PCP/clinics check the Healthy Connections roster each month to see list of newly assigned participants and conduct outreach to encourage establishing care. Participants not submitting a choice of provider will be assigned to an HC clinic up to 90-days after eligibility, to be effective the first of the following month, based on the following criteria: • Assign participants to a clinic where they are currently receiving care. • Assign family members to a clinic where other family members are enrolled, if appropriate. • Assign participants to a prior Healthy Connections clinic, when applicable. • Assign participants to a clinic based on geographic location. • Assign participants based on rotation schedule agreed upon by clinic. 7.2.5. Changing Enrollment in Healthy Connections Healthy Connections participants will be enrolled based on a fixed enrollment process. A set period of time is designated during the year when participants are allowed to change their PCP without cause. This is commonly known as the “annual enrollment period”. Fixed enrollment encourages a long-term provider-patient relationship resulting in the participant receiving a consistent source of care, provides for better patient outcomes and supports the value-based model of care. Changes in enrollment are to be submitted by the participant or an authorized representative. HC clinics may submit HC enrollment forms on behalf of a participant, as long as the enrollment form is completed and signed by the participant or an authorized representative. July 1, 2025 Page 106 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers Participants or their authorized representatives are allowed to initiate a change for any reason: • During the annual enrollment period of July and August; • Within the first ninety (90) days of enrollment with a new HC service location/clinic; • Due to automatic re-enrollment and the participant misses any part of the annual open enrollment period; or • To request a different service location/clinic within the HC Organization (same Tax ID). Participants will remain enrolled with their primary care provider unless they qualify for a change. To see if a participant qualifies to change their provider, have them contact Healthy Connections. Some reasons for change include: • Participant requests different PCP than one assigned by the Department; • Participant moved outside of the PCP’s service area; • Participant requests different PCP to allow members of a household to be enrolled with the same PCP (one medical home); • Participant requests change due to changing to/from a specialty provider (i.e., Pediatrics, etc.); • Participant chooses to follow PCP to a different HC organization, to maintain the existing relationship with the PCP; or • Other reasons determined to be acceptable by the Department. Requests to change providers will be verified and approved if they meet Fixed Enrollment criteria. A request to change is not guaranteed and may not be acted on immediately. As a result, it is important for providers to obtain referrals from the provider of record in the system prior to rendering services. Failure to adhere to these policies may result in investigation by the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit. a) References: Changing Enrollment in Healthy Connections (i) Idaho Medicaid Publications Fixed Enrollment Changes for the Idaho Medicaid Healthy Connections Program, Information Release MA19-12 (8/1/2019).

Exceptions & Exemptions to HC Enrollment Participants meeting the exception or exemption criteria in this section are not required to enroll in the Healthy Connections Program. A referral is not needed for services rendered to participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections. Participants are not required to enroll in Healthy Connections who meet the following exception criteria: • The participant has an eligibility period that is less than three (3) months; • The participant has an eligibility period that is only retroactive; • The participant only has Qualified Medicare Beneficiary eligibility; • The participant is enrolled in one of the managed care programs for Dual Eligible participants; • The participant resides in long-term care or ICF/IID facility; or July 1, 2025 Page 107 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • The participant resides in a non-mandatory county where there are not adequate numbers of providers to deliver primary care case management services. Participants may opt out of Healthy Connections by requesting and qualifying for one of the following exemption reasons: • Participant is unable to access a Healthy Connections provider within a distance of thirty (30) miles or within thirty (30) minutes to obtain primary care services; • Participant has an existing relationship with a primary care provider or clinic (currently under the care) who is not participating in Healthy Connections or is a Health Home provider. However, once the participant chooses to enroll with or receive services from an HC clinic, the participant no longer qualifies for an exemption (verified annually); • Participant has Medicare as their primary healthcare plan; • Participant is a member of a federally recognized tribe; or • Participant is under 19 years of age and is: o Eligible for SSI under Title XVI; o Eligible under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act, qualified disabled children; or o Receiving foster care or adoption assistance. Exempted participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections will appear as “Exempt from Healthy Connections” when checking eligibility. At any time, a participant with an exemption, but not an exception, may opt to enroll with a Healthy Connections provider. 7.2.7. Participant Disenrollment by the Provider A PCP may choose to withdraw as the participant’s primary care provider and must give written notice to both the participant and the Department at least (30) days prior to the date of disenrollment. Failure by the PCP to notify Healthy Connections will result in continued obligation to provide care and/or referrals until notice is received. The Department may waive this notice on a case-by-case basis. The written notice from the PCP must give the enrollee the reason for the request for disenrollment. A PCP may request disenrollment of a participant because: • Participant has been previously discharged from the practice – PCP to provide copy of dismissal notice sent to participant • A documented, ongoing pattern of failure on the part of the participant to keep scheduled appointments • A documented situation where there is an inability by the PCP, after making a reasonable effort to maintain a mutually satisfactory PCP/participant relationship • Behavior of the participant that is disruptive or abusive (and not related to his/her special needs) to the extent that the PCP’s ability to furnish services to the participant or other participants is impaired. A PCP may not request disenrollment because of: • An adverse change in the participant’s health status • The participant’s over/under utilization of medical services • The participant’s diminished mental capacity • The participant’s uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or her special needs (except when his or her continued enrollment seriously impairs a PCP’s ability to furnish services to the participant of other participants) Upon the reassignment of the participant to a new PCP, the former PCP must transfer a copy of the participant’s medical records to the new PCP when requested by the participant. July 1, 2025 Page 108 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 7.3. Referrals A referral is a documented communication from a participant’s PCP of record to another Medicaid provider for a specific covered service.

The PCP plays a key role in linking participants with community resources to facilitate referrals and respond to the participant’s medical and social needs. 7.3.1. Important Referral Policy Reminders • Referrals must always be received prior to delivery of care. • Backdated or retroactive referrals are not acceptable. Any service provided with a backdated or retroactive referral is considered to be non-covered and may be subject to recoupment and civil monetary penalties. • Referral requirements apply regardless of Medicare or other insurance coverage. • The referral must be documented in the records of both the referring and receiving providers to be valid. • Referrals entered online in the HealthPAS portal meet the referral documentation requirements. • Once received a referral remains active even if the participant changes their enrollment with an HC clinic. • Providers receiving referrals may also forward the referral to another Medicaid provider as long as the date and scope of the referral meets the condition stated in the original referral. • The referral requirement for primary care services accessed between HC clinics affiliated either by the same NPI, Tax ID or Provider Network owned by the same organization (not VCO affiliation) is at the discretion of the HC clinic/organization of record. • Referral authority may be externally delegated to an “outside organization” for the purposes of care coverage. However, externally delegated referral authority must be documented in the covering HC service location for the specific visit. • In the event that a service not requiring a referral begins and must be changed to a service that requires a referral, one is not required. However, the medical documentation must support the service change. • Referrals cannot be accepted in lieu of a prior authorization. PA’s are for certain services that require review and approval prior to being provided. • When verifying eligibility, if no HC clinic is indicated or “Exempt from Healthy Connections” is returned, no referral is required. • If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, clinic is required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant or providing a one-time referral and working with participant to schedule an appointment. • Healthy Connections enrolls to the clinic, not a specific provider. Any HC provider that participates and provides primary care can authorize a referral for any enrolled participant. • Historical note: In March 2020, referral requirements were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective July 1, 2021, referral requirements were reinstated. 7.3.2. Referral Elements Effective 2/1/2016, the following are the required core referral elements: • Date issued; • Name of HC PCP or clinic issuing referral; • Participant information; July 1, 2025 Page 109 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • Referred-to provider (suggest obtaining billing organization NPI to find accurate location in system); • Start and end date of the referral (not to exceed one year); • Diagnosis and/or Condition (entered in Notes section in HealthPAS); and • Referral reason: o Consultation/diagnosis only; o Diagnose, treat, and/or forward to specialty provider; o One time visit until seen by PCP; and o Any additional referral limits or restrictions. 7.3.3.

Follow-up Communication Requirements for Referrals Providers who receive Healthy Connections referrals must communicate their assessment, recommendations, or progress back to the HC PCP of record within a timely manner. Services provided for an extended period shall be reported to the PCP with an annual report, or more frequently if significant changes occur in the patient’s overall health. Failure to communicate findings to the PCP may result in services being considered non-covered and subject to recoupment. 7.3.6. Services Not Requiring an HC PCP Referral The following services do not require a referral by the Healthy Connections Primary Care Provider. If the service is not on this list, it may require a referral.

Reimbursement for Services Requiring a Referral It is the responsibility of the billing provider to ensure a referral is documented and meets the requirements outlined in the Provider Handbook prior to rendering services. Claims will process regardless of referral status. The referral field in the claims processing system is a misnomer and is intended for prior authorization numbers. Entering a referral number on the claim will cause the claim to deny. Services provided and billed to Medicaid without a referral, when one is required, are subject to sanctions, recoupment or both. Billing Medicaid for services without a correct and complete referral is not allowed. Any payments received as a result of a missing or incomplete referral are subject to recoupment and/or assessment of civil monetary penalties by the Department. See the Participant Financial Responsibility section for more information about when billing participants is permissible. 7.3.8. School Based Health Centers A School Based Health Center (SBHC) is defined as a health center located at an elementary, middle, or high school. College health services do not qualify as an SBHC. SBHCs do not require a referral for acute care services provided to a student so long as all requirements of this section are met: July 1, 2025 Page 112 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • The participant’s PCP must be contacted within three business days with written or electronic documentation for coordination of care. • Documentation must include: o A visit summary; o Prescriptions or orders issued; and o Any other information the PCP may need to be aware of. • If secondary or specialty care is medically necessary, the SBHC provider will refer the student back to their HC PCP. • The student’s parent/guardian must be contacted with the visit outcome and any follow-up care recommendations. An SBHC is eligible to be a mobile unit. A provider must enroll each of the locations under their pay-to NPI to represent which school the services would be occurring at. If a mobile SBHC provider delivered services at a non-school location, they would need to bill a place of service location that is equivalent to a generic mobile unit in addition to the place of service identifier. The SBHC will be subject to periodic evaluation of policy compliance for care coordination by Department staff to include patient medical record reviews. a) References: School Based Health Centers (i) Idaho Medicaid Publications “School-Based Health Centers.” MedicAide Newsletter, May 2023, https://www.idmedicaid.com/MedicAide%20Newsletters/May%202023%20MedicAide.pdf. 7.3.9. Urgent Care Services Effective January 1, 2020, Healthy Connections referrals will not be required for urgent care services accessed at urgent care centers, Health Districts or Healthy Connections Clinics that meet the criteria below. Urgent care services for this purpose are medical services used in the treatment of acute illness or injury which require prompt attention, but generally are not serious enough to require an emergency room visit. Participants are encouraged to always call their Primary Care Provider first as they may offer same day or walk-in appointments. If their Primary Care Provider’s office is closed or they are unable to be seen immediately for an urgent medical need, they may be seen at a qualified Urgent Care, Health District or Healthy Connections Clinic. The Department encourages providers to work together within their medical neighborhoods to effectively coordinate patient care. Urgent",

Healthy Connections Value Care The Healthy Connections Value Care (HCVC) program, started on January 1, 2022. Under this program, Value Care Organizations (VCOs), contracted with the Department, are held accountable for improving participant health outcomes and controlling costs. Idaho Medicaid Healthy Connections (HC) organizations may choose to form their own VCO and contract directly with the Department. Alternatively, they may choose to affiliate with hospitals, primary care organizations, and other medical service organizations to form a VCO, which then contracts with the Department. The goals of HCVC: • Improve the health of Idahoans; • Provide high-quality, cost effective care • Reward organizations by sharing shared savings New value care organization (VCO) contracts or changes in existing VCO contracts are due annually by September 1st. Each VCO must have a minimum of 2,000 attributed participants. VCO contracts must include Healthy Connections (HC) service locations and acute care hospital affiliations. An agreement between each VCO and affiliated HC organization shall be in place prior to each performance year. This is a separate and unique agreement from the Healthy Connections Coordinated Care Agreement. It is the responsibility of the VCO to report changes in affiliated HC service locations to the Department. • The VCO will inform the Department of their risk options. • The Department will inform the VCO of their quality targets and the statewide standardized total cost of care per member per month (PMPM) cost. The VCO contract with the Department will renew automatically annually. For additional information, please visit the Healthy Connections and Healthy Connections Value Care website. 8.1.

Covered Services and Limitations: General Unless otherwise noted, services must be provided directly to the participant to be eligible for reimbursement. 9.1. Medical Necessity State Medicaid programs are mandated to only pay for medically necessary services and items covered in Idaho Medicaid’s State Plan for adults twenty-one years of age and older. A service or item is considered medically necessary when it is reasonably calculated to prevent, diagnose, or treat conditions in the participant that endanger life, cause pain, cause functionally significant deformity or malfunction. Only effective treatments that are the most conservative (including setting, duration and frequency), or least costly, are considered eligible. The setting a participant receives services in, and the methods or items utilized must be safe and effective. The service or item must be of a quality that meets professionally- recognized standards of health care and substantiated by records including evidence of such medical necessity and quality. Items and services are not provided for the convenience of the patient, provider or caregiver. Diagnoses on claim submissions must support medical necessity for the services provided. Participants under the age of 21 have an expanded definition for medical necessity to correct or ameliorate defects, physical and mental illness, and conditions discovered by the screening services as defined in Section 1905(r) of the SSA, whether or not such services are covered under the State Plan. Although services under Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) are not required to be within the State Plan, they must fall into a category of service listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, be considered safe and effective, and meet acceptable standards of medical practice. If services not covered under the State Plan are needed, an EPSDT request form must be submitted to the Department for prior authorization. A service or item that has received FDA approval or its own CPT®/HCPCS code is not automatically considered a medically necessary service or item. It must be consistent with generally accepted professional medical standards of care and be verified through independent study published in peer-reviewed literature before being considered for medical necessity. In the absence of Idaho Medicaid direction for medical necessity criteria of covered items and services, the provider should default to",

It must be consistent with generally accepted professional medical standards of care and be verified through independent study published in peer-reviewed literature before being considered for medical necessity. In the absence of Idaho Medicaid direction for medical necessity criteria of covered items and services, the provider should default to Medicare standards. Screening services are generally not medically necessary. Screening is used to detect an undiagnosed disease where early detection may prevent harm, and where the patient has no signs, symptoms, laboratory evidence, radiological evidence or personal history of the disease. Idaho Medicaid covers screening services as mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with an “A” or “B” recommendation, or when listed in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Bright Futures periodicity schedule without co-payment. When other modes of transportation are unavailable or are not practical, Non-Emergency Transportation (NEMT) is covered for services prior authorized as EPSDT or listed on the AAP Bright Futures periodicity schedule. See Non-Covered and Excluded Services for information about items and services that may not be reimbursable. See the Early & Periodic Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment (EPSDT) section for more information and how to request services that may exceed those under State Plan for participants under the age of 21.

Experimental/Investigational Services The Department uses the terms experimental and investigational interchangeably. Services determined to be experimental are non-covered. All services and follow-ups directly associated with an experimental service are also excluded from reimbursement. The Department lists services it considers experimental throughout the handbook for provider convenience, however, on services without stated guidance from the Department providers bear a responsibility to determine if a service meets the definition of Medical Necessity and if it would be considered experimental. A service is experimental if: • It is being provided as part of a phase 1 clinical trial; • They are used to gain further evidence or knowledge; • It tests the usefulness (i.e., efficacy) of a drug or treatment; • There is inadequate data to provide the reasonable expectation that the service would be as effective as the standard treatment for a condition; o This includes category III CPT® codes and proprietary laboratory analyses (PLA) codes. • Expert opinion suggests additional information is needed to assess the safety or efficacy of a treatment or procedure; • It is determined experimental or investigational under Medicare or their local area contractor, Noridian Healthcare; or • It is considered investigational by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Services determined to be experimental are not eligible for coverage under Early & Periodic Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment (EPSDT). Procedures and treatments may be eligible for coverage with a prior authorization under a focused case review on a case-by-case basis for participants of any age with a life threatening medical illness and no other available treatment options. The Department may at its discretion seek an independent professional opinion if there is insufficient information to render a coverage decision.

Qualifying Clinical Trials The definition of a “qualifying clinical trial” is a trial related to “the prevention, detection, or treatment of any serious or life-threatening disease or condition.” This includes a trial funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or other federal-approved entities. Routine costs are covered during a clinical trial and include any item or service provided to “prevent, diagnose, monitor, or treat complications resulting from participation in the qualifying clinical trial, to the extent that the provision of such items or services to the participant would otherwise be covered outside the course of participation in the qualifying clinical trial under the state plan or waiver. The investigational item or service that is the subject of the clinical trial is not covered. Services not covered under the state plan or waiver but required by the clinical trial are not covered. Routine participant costs are covered regardless of where the clinical trial is conducted, including out-of-state, or based on whether the principal investigator or provider treating the participant in connection with the clinical trial is outside of the network of the participant’s MCO. Usual requirements regarding rates, billing processes, and prior authorization for out- of-state care, diagnostics, and interventions apply. Routine participant cost does not include any item or service provided to the participant solely to satisfy data collection and analysis for the qualifying clinical trial that is not used in the direct clinical management of the participant",

Routine participant cost does not include any item or service provided to the participant solely to satisfy data collection and analysis for the qualifying clinical trial that is not used in the direct clinical management of the participant and is not otherwise covered under the state plan or waiver. Idaho Medicaid requests for an attestation form to be completed and faxed to the Medical Care Unit at 877-314-8782 before participants start receiving services through a clinical trial. The attestation form must be signed by the principal investigator (PI) or their delegated authority (if they have a documented process for the delegation of authority) and the participant’s health care provider that is providing the care during the trial. Participation in a clinical trial itself does not require prior authorization (PA). However, services associated with routine medical costs while in a clinical trial may have PA requirements that still apply. Submit completed PA request using an Idaho Medicaid Surgery & Procedure PA form, when required. Fax the complete form and required documentation to 877-314-8779. For participants in an MCO, providers must follow the process required by the MCO. 9.3.1.

Service Limitations Service limitations restrict services based on state and federal rules and regulations. Each procedure and revenue code may be reviewed for a variety of limitations. Limitations include, but are not limited to: • Services bundled when rendered by the same provider; • Amount of services or items in a given time frame; • Reimbursement caps during a time period; • Medical necessity; • Age of the participant; and • Lifetime procedures. Some services that exceed limitations may be covered with a prior authorization. Refer to your specific Provider Guidelines carefully for additional information. Policy limitations can be reviewed on request if the allowed amount doesn’t meet the average participants’ needs. Supporting documentation should be submitted to demonstrate why the current limitation would not meet the average participant’s medical needs. Requests may be submitted to MCPT@dhw.idaho.gov. July 1, 2025 Page 123 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 9.6. Informational Codes Services represented by informational only codes are not excluded from coverage by statute and meet all technical requirements for coverage, but have been determined non-covered for separate reimbursement because they are considered reimbursed in the coverage of another procedure code. Informational only codes do not appear on the Idaho Medicaid Fee Schedule as they are considered non-covered services for the purposes of reimbursement. A code that is informational only is not separately reimbursable regardless of the revenue code, CPT® or HCPCS code selected for billing. Services coded as informational only cannot be billed under a CPT® or HCPCS defined as unlisted or miscellaneous or billed under a revenue code that does not require a CPT® or HCPCS. These billing practice will be subject to recoupment and penalties. See Idaho Medicaid Claim Standards in the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information about correct coding. 9.6.1.

Interpretive Services for Sterilization Procedures The interpreter/translator is responsible for ensuring the sterilization consent form is effectively, accurately and impartially communicated to the participant or their guardian. The statement certifies the interpreter/translator’s discharge of their duty, their belief that the participant understood the procedure, and that the participant was allowed to ask questions. If the interpreter/translator fails to complete the statement correctly, all claims regarding the sterilization will be denied including claims from the hospital, physician and anesthesiologist. See Sterilization Procedures in the Medical Services, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information. 9.11.3. Interpretive Services – Reimbursement Idaho Medicaid will reimburse for interpretation, translation, Braille and sign language services provided to participants in person or through virtual care. Reimbursement is also available when interpretive services are provided to the parent or guardian of a child under 18. The service is only eligible for reimbursement if the provider has no alternative means of oral or written communication. No additional reimbursement is available for multilingual providers that share a language with the participant. Interpreters and translators must meet state and professional licensure requirements and be at least eighteen years of age. See the Virtual Care Services section for more information about reimbursement eligibility using virtual care services. Idaho Medicaid does not reimburse for: • Administrative services such as: o Scheduling or cancelling appointments; o Making reminder calls; o The interpreter’s travel time; or o No show appointments; • Services in conjunction with a non-covered, non-reimbursable, or excluded service; July 1, 2025 Page 135 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers • Services provided by an immediate family member such as a parent, spouse, sibling or child; • Services provided through a Medicaid managed care contractor. Contact the managed care contractor to see if they reimburse separately for interpretive services; • Teaching sign language; • Providers not on the fee-for-service model; • Services through institutional providers, hospitals or facilities; or • The interpreter or translator’s waiting time, except when the participant is in surgery or receiving other covered services such as radiology. Interpretive Services are billed under T1013 (Language Interpretive – Oral Services, per 15 minutes) and T1013-CG (Sign Language Interpretive Services, per 15 minutes). 9.11.4.

July 1, 2025 Page 138 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 9.13. Virtual Care Services Virtual care or telehealth means providing medically necessary health care services without actual physical contact, using electronic means. Under Idaho Medicaid this means the participant and the provider opt to interact in real-time or “live” from two physically different locations, by video or telephone. Services delivered as virtual services are considered for reimbursement when rendered within the provider’s scope of practice and billed according to all applicable administrative rules, policy, federal and state regulations, including those for protected health information and personal privacy. Covered services may be delivered via virtual services when: • The service can be safely and effectively delivered; • The service fully meets the code definition; • The service is billed with the FQ or GT modifier; and • All other existing coverage criteria are met. Participants (and/or legal guardians), not exempted by State of Federal law, must be informed and consent to the delivery models, and informed of any applicable cost-sharing, provider qualifications, treatment methods, and limitations. The provider must give adequate training on the technology. If virtual services are offered, it is the rendering provider’s responsibility to ensure meaningful access to virtual services for individuals with difficulty communicating due to a medical condition, who need accommodation because of a disability, advanced age, or limited English proficiency. Meaningful access includes but is not limited to ensuring high-quality audio with clear and audible transmission of voices and adequate training to users of the technology. Any electronic or written information must be provided to the participant before the virtual care appointment and provided in a form and manner which the participant can understand. The provider must make reasonable accommodations through methods such as a translator or qualified interpreter when appropriate. Remote interpreting may not be appropriate in some circumstances The participant (and/or legal guardian) has the right to end the service or refuse the delivery of service at any time and have access to all medical information resulting from the service without affecting their right to future care or treatment. If the participant (or legal guardian) indicates that they want to stop using the technology, the service should cease immediately, and an alternative (in-person) appointment should be scheduled. Providers can deliver virtual care services from any location in the United States. Providers must meet all applicable licensure requirements required by the State of Idaho. Services provided via asynchronous communication are not reimbursable under Idaho Medicaid. However, remote monitoring services are covered for established patients. Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) and Remote Physiological Monitoring (RTM) cannot be billed together and must be billed as a distinct and separate service. The use of virtual care services does not change Health Connections referral or prior authorization requirements established for the service. For a primary care provider to be reimbursed for virtual care services, the provider must be able to facilitate an in-person visit if necessary to treat the participant’s condition. Reporting of test results only is not covered as a virtual service. Medicaid policy is not subject to Medicare restrictions for virtual care unless the participant has Medicare primary. Otherwise, all Medicaid providers, including federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health centers (RHCs), and Indian health clinics (IHCs) may bill for virtual care services according to these guidelines. July 1, 2025 Page 139 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 9.13.1. Virtual Care Services – Technical Requirements Video must be provided in real-time with full motion video and audio that delivers high-quality video images that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or irregular pauses in communication. Transmission of voices must be clear and audible. 9.13.2. Virtual Care Services – Documentation The individual treatment record must include written documentation of evaluation process, the services provided, participant consent, participant outcomes, and those services were delivered via virtual care. The documentation must be of the same quality as is originated during an in-person visit, including but not limited to, billing the CPT® or HCPCS code with the number of minutes closest to the actual time",

Virtual Care Services – Documentation The individual treatment record must include written documentation of evaluation process, the services provided, participant consent, participant outcomes, and those services were delivered via virtual care. The documentation must be of the same quality as is originated during an in-person visit, including but not limited to, billing the CPT® or HCPCS code with the number of minutes closest to the actual time spent providing the service, service type, amount, frequency, duration and time spent with the participant. If the code is a timed code of 15-minute increments, it must be billed with a number of units as described in the Billing 15-Minute Timed Codes section of the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. These documentation requirements are specific to delivery via virtual care and are in addition to any other documentation requirements specific to the area of service (i.e., IEP requirements for school-based services). 9.13.3. Virtual Care Services – Reimbursement Only one eligible provider may be reimbursed per service per participant per date of service. No reimbursement is available for the use of equipment at the originating or remote sites. Reimbursement is also not available for services that are interrupted and/or terminated early due to equipment difficulties. Claims for services delivered via virtual care will be reimbursed at the same rate as face-to-face services. A service is considered audio only if 50% or more of the service is provided via audio only. Virtual service visits will be subject to retrospective review as appropriate. Idaho Medicaid uses places of service 02 (Telehealth provided other than in patient’s home) and 10 (Telehealth provided in patient’s home). Providers must use these places of service on claims for virtual care. When a participant is in the office and receiving virtual care from a provider at their home, out-of-state or elsewhere, box 32 of the CMS-1500 claim form uses the location of the participant, not the provider. Claims for virtual care must include one of the following modifiers: • FQ – A telehealth service was furnished using real-time audio-only communication technology. • GT – A telehealth service was furnished using real-time audio-visual communication technology. Additionally, providers can also use the following modifier in conjunction with one of the above: • FR – A supervising practitioner was present through a real-time two-way, audio/video communication technology. FQHC, RHC or IHS providers should not report the GT or FQ modifier with encounter code T1015, but should include it with each applicable supporting code.

July 1, 2025 Page 142 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers 9.14. Weight Management Services Weight management services are covered for Medicaid participants through the behavioral health benefit of the Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program. Weight management services are not administered through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan. 9.14.1. Eligible Participants: Weight Management Services Medicaid participants are eligible for weight management services when criteria is met with a few exceptions. Medicaid participants enrolled in one of the Managed Care Programs for Dual Eligible Participants may receive applicable PHA benefits through the health plan in which they are enrolled. Participants eligible for Medicaid through Katie Beckett are not eligible for PHA benefits. Participants interested in the Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program begin by visiting their primary care provider (PCP). The PCP: • Determines if the participant meets the Body Mass Index (BMI) requirements for their age group to have one of the covered diagnoses in the table below; • Confirms the participant does not have an excluded eligibility; and • Discusses weight management programs with patient and help to identify obtainable goals. Covered Diagnoses for Weight Management Services ICD-10-CM Description E66.01 Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories. 100lbs overweight. E66.09 Other obesity due to excess calories. BMI of 30 or higher. E66.1 Drug-induced obesity. BMI of 30 or higher. E66.3 Overweight. BMI between 25 and 29.9. Participants over the age of 21 with this diagnosis are not eligible. E66.8 Other obesity. BMI of 30 or higher. E66.9 Obesity, unspecified. BMI of 30 or higher. R63.6 Underweight If the PCP determines the participant meets the criteria for the behavioral PHA benefit, the PCP prints and completes section 1 of the Idaho Medicaid Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) Weight Management Agreement Form and provides it to the participant or their guardian. The PCP should also provide the PHA Weight Management Provider List if the participant hasn’t already found an enrolled weight management services provider. The participant must select a weight management program from an enrolled provider. The participant must then take the form to their weight management provider to receive services. The form does not need to specify the provider so long as they are enrolled in the Idaho Medicaid program. The form is only valid if the weight management provider returns it to the Medical Care Unit within two (2) months of the PCP’s signature. a) Participants Under 21 Participants between age five (5) and twenty-one (21) may qualify for weight management services if they have a body mass index (BMI) that falls into either the overweight, obese, or underweight category as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen. July 1, 2025 Page 143 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers b) Participants Over 21 Participants twenty-one (21) years of age and older with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, or 18½ or lower, may qualify for the weight management program. c) References: Eligible Participants – Weight Management Services (i) State Regulations “Behavioral PHA.” IDAPA 16.03.26, “Medicaid Plan Benefits,” Sec. 191.01.

Provider Qualifications: Weight Management Services Providers of weight management services include, but are not limited to, life style coaches and other suppliers in the National Diabetes Prevention program, gyms, health clubs and registered dietitians. Providers, including those that are already enrolled as another provider type, must enroll as an atypical provider with Idaho Medicaid prior to providing weight management services under the Preventive Health Program (PHA). Providers must be enrolled independently as the direct/pay-to and cannot bill as a rendering under a group NPI. Registered dietitians, however, enrolled with Medicaid do not have to complete a separate enrollment to provide weight management services within the scope of their licensure. A registered dietitian can bill for their services as a rendering provider under a group NPI or be a direct/pay-to provider.

They must also be established as a business that serves the general public. See the Provider Enrollment section for more information on enrolling as an Idaho Medicaid provider. 9.14.3. Covered Services and Limitations: Weight Management Services The behavioral benefit of the Preventive Health Program (PHA) awards points to enrolled Medicaid participants to redeem for weight management services. Weight management services must either address physical fitness, balanced diet or personal health education. These can include services under the National Diabetes Prevention Program, gym fees, healthy lifestyle classes or nutrition classes. Participants earn 200 points under the behavioral benefit during each benefit period. Benefit periods last twelve months from when the participant is approved for the program. Participants may reapply after or near the end of their benefit period if they still meet criteria for the program. Benefit periods cannot overlap. Points cannot be transferred to another participant. Any points not utilized during their issued benefit period, expire. Points can be July 1, 2025 Page 144 of 162 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers redeemed by voucher with a Medicaid enrolled provider at a rate of one-point to one-dollar towards eligible services. Weight management providers must verify eligibility when they receive the voucher. Providers can only verify eligibility for PHA weight management services by calling Gainwell Technologies customer service at 1 (866) 686-4272. a) References: Covered Services and Limitations – Weight Management Services (i) State Regulations “Behavioral PHA.” IDAPA 16.03.26, “Medicaid Plan Benefits,” Sec. 193.01.

Reimbursement: Weight Management Services Services must meet all Medicaid requirements to be eligible for reimbursement. Idaho Medicaid reimburses weight management services on a fee-for-service basis. Services are reimbursed at 100% of the invoiced amount up to the maximum on the participant’s voucher, so long as the participant has points remaining to redeem. Once a participant has exhausted their benefit, the participant is liable for any remaining balance due from services provided under the PHA behavioral benefit that are not otherwise covered by Idaho Medicaid. See the Participant Financial Responsibility section for requirements on billing a participant.

CHIP Wellness Incentive Children enrolled in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are required to pay a monthly premium of $10 or $15. The Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program as part of its wellness benefit provides ten (10) points a month to participants, who keep up-to-date on their well child exams and immunizations. Points are then converted into a $10 credit towards the participant’s monthly CHIP premium. Preventive care including well child exams, vaccines and their administration (immunizations) are not subject to copayments. Points accumulated through the PHA wellness benefit are only redeemable towards CHIP premiums. A participant can only receive 120 points in a twelve-month period. Points cannot be transferred to another participant. Any points not utilized during their issued twelve-month period, expire. Statements are mailed to parents on a monthly basis. If a parent knows their child is up-to- date on their well checks and immunizations, they may ask their primary care provider (PCP) to fax verification of the checkup or immunizations to the Medical Care Unit at 1 (877) 845- 3956. If you have questions about the PHA program, please call the Medical Care Unit toll free at 1 (877) 364-1843.

No payment will be made by the Department on behalf of any eligible medical assistance participant to any long-term care facility which, in the judgment of the IOC/UC Team, is admitting individuals for care or services which are beyond the facility's licensed level of care or capability. (3-19-07) 02. Authorization of Long-Term Care Payment. If it has been determined that a person eligible for medical assistance is entitled to medical assistance participation in the cost of long-term care, and that the facility selected by the participant is licensed and certified to provide the level of care the participant requires, the Field Office will forward to such facility an “Authorization for Long-Term Care Payment” form HW 0459. (3-19-07) 223. NURSING FACILITY: CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING NEED. The participant requires nursing facility level of care when an adult meets one (1) of the Resource Utilization Group (RUG III) classifications or when a child meets one (1) or more of the criteria described in Subsections 223.02, 223.03, 223.04 or 223.05 of this rule.

The participant requires nursing facility level of care when an adult meets one (1) of the Resource Utilization Group (RUG III) classifications or when a child meets one (1) or more of the criteria described in Subsections 223.02, 223.03, 223.04 or 223.05 of this rule. A child is an individual from age zero (0) through eighteen (18) years; an adult is an individual more than eighteen (18) years of age. (4-2-08) 01. Required Assessment for Adults. A standard assessment will be approved by the Department for all adults requesting services with requirements for nursing facility level of care. The Department will specify the instrument to be used. (4-2-08) 02. Supervision Required for Children. Where the inherent complexity of a service prescribed by the physician is such that it can be safely and effectively performed only by or under the supervision of a licensed nurse or licensed physical or occupational therapist. (3-19-07) 03. Preventing Deterioration for Children. Skilled care is needed to prevent, to the extent possible, deterioration of the child's condition or to sustain current capacities, regardless of the restoration potential of a child, even where full recovery or medical improvement is not possible. (3-19-07) 04. Specific Needs for Children. When the plan of care, risk factors, and aggregate of health care needs is such that the assessments, interventions, or supervision of the child necessitates the skills of a licensed nurse or a licensed physical therapist or licensed occupational therapist. In such cases, the specific needs or activities must be documented by the physician's orders, progress notes, plan of care, and nursing and therapy notes. (3-19-07) 05. Nursing Facility Level of Care for Children. Using the criteria found in Subsections 223.02, 223.03, and 223.04 of these rules, plus consideration of the developmental milestones, based on the age of the child, the Department's RMS will determine nursing facility level of care. (4-2-08) 06. Conditions of Payment. (3-19-07) a. As a condition of payment by the Department for long-term care on behalf of medical assistance participants, each fully licensed long-term care facility is to be under the supervision of an administrator who is currently licensed under the laws of the state of Idaho and in accordance with the rules of the Bureau of Occupational Licenses. (3-19-07) b. Payment by the Department for the cost of long-term care excludes the date of the participant’s discharge, unless the day of discharge occurs on the same day as admission; then, one (1) day of care is deemed to exist. When a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, the date of death is covered, regardless of the time of death. (3-21-12) 224. NURSING FACILITY: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where an individual is determined eligible for medical assistance participation in the cost of his long term care, the Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facility by the amount of his income considered available IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 225 Page 39 to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.05, “Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD),” Sections 721 through 726. The amount which the medical assistance participant receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability under IDAPA 16.03.05, “Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD),” Section 317. (3-19-07) 225. NURSING FACILITY: COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS. An institution must provide, on a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals; who because of their mental or physical condition require care and services above the level of room, board, and supervision. (3-19-07) 01. Nursing Facility Care. The minimum content of care and services for nursing facility patients must include the following: (3-19-07) a. Room and board; (3-19-07) b. Bed and bathroom linens; (3-19-07) c. Nursing care, including special feeding if needed; (3-19-07) d. Personal services; (3-19-07) e.

(3-4-11) 02. Skilled Services. Skilled services include services which could qualify as either skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitative services, which include: (3-19-07) a. Overall management and evaluation of the care plan. The development, management, and evaluation of a resident's care plan, based on the physician's orders, constitute skilled services when, in terms of the patient's physical or mental condition, such development, management, and evaluation necessitate the involvement of technical or professional personnel to meet his needs, promote his recovery, and assure his medical safety. This would include the management of a plan involving only a variety of personal care services where, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of such services necessitates the involvement of technical or professional personnel. Where the patient's overall condition would support a finding that his recovery and safety could be assured only if the total IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 226 Page 40 care he requires is planned, managed, and evaluated by technical or professional personnel, it would be appropriate to infer that skilled services are being provided. (3-19-07) b. Observation and assessment of the resident's changing condition. When the resident's condition is such that the skills of a licensed nurse or other technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for possible modification of treatment and the initiation of additional medical procedures until his condition is stabilized, such services constitute skilled services. (3-19-07) 03. Direct Skilled Nursing Services. Direct skilled nursing services include the following: (3-19-07) a. Intravenous injections; intravenous feedings; intramuscular or subcutaneous injection required on more than one (1) shift; (3-19-07) b. Nasopharyngeal feedings; (3-19-07) c. Nasopharyngeal and tracheotomy aspiration; (3-19-07) d. Insertion and sterile irrigation and replacement of catheters; (3-19-07) e. Application of dressings involving prescription medications or aseptic techniques; (3-19-07) f. Treatment of extensive decubitus ulcers or other widespread skin disorders; (3-19-07) g. Heat treatments which have been specifically ordered by a physician as part of treatment and which require observation by nurses to adequately evaluate the resident's progress; and (3-19-07) h. Initial phases of a regimen involving administration of oxygen. (3-19-07) 04. Direct Skilled Rehabilitative Services. Direct skilled rehabilitative services include the following: (3-19-07) a. Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential, services concurrent with the management of a resident's care plan, including tests and measurements of range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, functional ability, activities of daily living, perceptual deficits, speech and language or hearing disorders; (3-19-07) b. Therapeutic exercises or activities which, because of the type of exercises employed or the condition of the resident, must be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist or occupational therapist to ensure the safety of the resident and the effectiveness of the treatment; (3-19-07) c. Gait evaluation and training furnished by a physical or occupational therapist to restore function in a resident whose ability to walk has been impaired by neurological, muscular, or skeletal abnormality; and (3-19-07) d. Ultrasound, short-wave, and microwave therapy treatments by a licensed physical therapist. (3-19-07) 05. Other Treatment and Modalities. Other treatment and modalities which include hot pack, hydroculator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, and whirlpool, in cases where the resident's condition is complicated by circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open wounds, fractures, or other complications, and the skills, knowledge, and judgement of a licensed physical therapist are required. (3-19-07) 226. NURSING FACILITY: PROCEDURAL RESPONSIBILITIES. 01. Nursing Facility Responsibility. Each nursing facility administrator, or his authorized representative must report the following information to the appropriate RMS within three (3) working days of the date the facility has knowledge of the following.

For a single individual, one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800);or (3-19-07) ii. For a married couple, two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800). (3-19-07) 02. Other Financial Information for Participant. Other information about a participant's finances which may potentially affect eligibility for medical assistance must be reported if the nursing facility has any knowledge of the participant’s financial information. (3-19-07) 227. PREADMISSION SCREENING AND ADDITIONAL RESIDENT REVIEW PROGRAM (PASARR). All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review program, (PASARR) as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart C. (3-19-07) 01. Background and Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to comply with and implement the PASARR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The purpose of those requirements is to prevent the placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or intellectual disabilities (ID) in a nursing facility unless their medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of care provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplished by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident review (ARR). Individuals, for whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or ID is likely, are identified for further screening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determined whether, because of the individual's physical and mental condition, he requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility. If the individual with MI or ID is determined to require a nursing facility level of care, it must also be determined whether the individual requires specialized services. PASARR applies to all individuals entering or residing in a nursing facility, regardless of payment source. (3-19-07) 02. Policy. It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in providing specialized services in the nursing facility setting makes it generally inappropriate to place individuals needing specialized services in an nursing facility. This policy is supported by the background and development of the federal PASARR requirements, including the narrow definition of mental illness adopted by federal law. While recognizing that there are exceptions, it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for nursing facility placement will not require services in excess of those required to be provided by nursing facilities by 42 CFR 483.45. (3-19-07) 03. Inter-Agency Agreement. The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and intellectual disabilities authorities as required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. (3-19-07) a. The “State Mental Health Authority” (SMHA) in the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (3-19-07) b. The “State Intellectual Disabilities or Developmental Disabilities Authority” (SDDA) in the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (3-19-07) 04. Coordination for PASARR. The PASARR process is a coordinated effort between the state Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and the nursing facility. PASARR activities will be coordinated through the Regional Medicaid Services (RMS). RMS is responsible for record retention and tracking functions. However, the nursing facility is responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the RMS, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, and their designees. Guidelines and procedures on how to comply with these requirements can be found in the “Statewide PASARR Procedures,” a reference guide. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 228 Page 42 (3-19-07) a. All required Level I screens and reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMS prior to admission to the facility. (3-19-07) b.

All required Level I screens and reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMS prior to admission to the facility. (3-19-07) b. When a nursing facility identifies an individual with MI or ID through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the nursing facility is responsible for contacting the SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), and assuring that a Level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility, or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. (3-19-07) c. Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified with MI or ID must be reviewed and a new determination made promptly after a significant change in his physical or mental condition. The facility must notify the RMS of any such change within two (2) working days of its occurrence. For the purpose of this section, significant change for the participant's mental condition means a change which may require the provision of specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that renders the participant incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program interventions. (3-19-07) 228. NURSING FACILITY: COORDINATION OF NURSING FACILITY ELIGIBILITY AND THE NEED FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES. Determinations as to the need for nursing facility care and determinations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations must often be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and the capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individual identified with MI and ID is admitted to a nursing facility, the nursing facility is responsible for meeting that individual's needs, except for the provision of specialized services. (3-19-07) 01. Level of Care. (3-19-07) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (3-19-07) b. Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determinations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for categorical determinations. When nursing facility level of care is determined appropriate categorically, the individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respite admissions, which cannot exceed thirty (30) consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. (3-19-07) 02. Specialized Services. Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for intellectual disabilities as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(2), are those services provided by the state which due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs which are not included in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be documented and included in both the resident assessment instrument and the plan of care. (3-19-07) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (3-19-07) b. Categorical determinations that specialized services are not needed may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. (3-19-07) 03. Penalty for Non-Compliance. No payment will be made for any services rendered by a nursing facility prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if required, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASARR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a nursing facility to other penalties as part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. (3-19-07) 04. Appeals. Discharges, transfers, and preadmission PASARR determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, and under Section 67-5229, Idaho Code. Appeals under this paragraph are made in accordance with the fair hearing provisions in IDAPA 16.05.03, “Rules Governing Contested IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 229 Page 43 Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.” (3-19-07) a. A Level I finding of MI or ID is not an appealable determination. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determination appeal. (3-19-07) b. In the event that the PASARR program is eliminated or made non-mandatory by an act of Congress, the provisions of Section 227 of these rules will cease to be operative on the effective date of any such act, without further action.

(3-19-07) 229. NURSING FACILITY: PREPAYMENT SCREEN AND DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO MEDICAID PAYMENT FOR NURSING FACILITY CARE AND SERVICES. The level of care for Title XIX and Title XXI payment purposes is determined by the Department. Necessity for payment is determined in accordance with 42 CFR 483 Subpart C and Section 1919(e) (7) of the Social Security Act. In the event a required Level II screen was not accomplished prior to admission, entitlement for Medicaid payment as established by the RMS will not be earlier than the date the Level II screen is completed, indicating that nursing facility placement is appropriate. (4-2-08) 01. Information Required for Medical Evaluation Determination. A current Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be provided to the Department. Additional supporting information may be requested. (3-19-07) 02. Information Required for Level I and II Screen Determination. An accurate Level I screen and when required, a Level II screen. (3-19-07) 230. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. 01. Provider Application and Certification. A facility must apply to participate as a nursing facility. (3-19-07) 02. Licensure and Certification. (3-19-07) a. Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing and Certification Agency determines the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to medical assistance participants. (3-19-07) b. If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing facility, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can be certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and Certification Agency must determine the facility's compliance with Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Medicare Agency. (3-19-07) c. If the Licensing and Certification Agency determines that a facility meets Title XIX certification standards for nursing facility care. The Department must certify to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for nursing facility level of care. (3-19-07) d. Upon receipt of the certification from the Licensing and Certification Agency, the Department may enter into a provider agreement with the long-term care facility. (3-19-07) e. After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Department, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Department (3-19-07) 232. -- 234. (RESERVED) 235. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. 01. Payment Methodology. Nursing facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with the payment methodologies as described in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 236 Page 44 02. Date of Discharge. Payment by the Department for the cost of long term care is to exclude the date of the participant's discharge. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. (3-21-12) 236. NURSING FACILITY: REASONABLE COST PRINCIPLES. To be allowable, costs must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to participants will result. (3-19-07) 01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles. (3-19-07) a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance with this chapter of rules found in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules, and Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modified by the exceptions contained herein, is used to identify cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost Report. (3-19-07) i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services, including normal standby costs. (3-19-07) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not be paid by the program. (3-19-07) b. Costs may vary from one institution to another because of a variety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Idaho Code, or",

It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid to the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and that its actual operating costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or service. (3-19-07) d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers incur, in the absence of clear evidence that the higher costs were unavoidable, the excess costs are not reimbursable. (3-19-07) 02. Costs Related to Patient Care. These include all necessary and proper costs in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs which are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity. They include costs such as depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance costs, administrative costs, costs of employee pension plans, normal standby costs, and others. Example: Depreciation is a method of systematically recognizing the declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the asset is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed based on property costs according to other provisions of this chapter.

Financial transactions will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the transaction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are contracts which are executed in the form of a lease. The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the property. If a lease contract is found to be in IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 237 Page 45 substance a purchase, the related payments are not allowable as lease or rental expense.

The notice of the results of the final retroactive adjustment will be sent even though the provider intends to request a hearing on the determination, or has appealed the Medicare Intermediary's determination of cost settlement. Where the determination shows that the provider is indebted to the Medicaid program because total interim and other payments exceed cost limits, the state will take the necessary action to recover overpayment, including the suspension of interim payments sixty (60) days after the provider's receipt of the notice. (3-19-07) 02. Recovery or Suspension. Such action of recovery or suspension will continue even after a request for an informal conference or hearing is filed with the state.

The rate for a nursing facility is the sum of the cost components described in Subsection 257.04 through 257.08 of this rule. In no case will the rate be set higher than the charge for like services to private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment is made as computed by the lower of costs or customary charges. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 with no allowance for inflation to the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. For the rate years beginning July 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports for periods ended in the preceding calendar year with no allowance for inflation to the prospective rate period. (4-4-13) 01. Applicable Case Mix Index (CMI). The Medicaid CMI used in establishing each facility's rate is calculated based on the most recent assessment for each Medicaid resident in the nursing facility on the first day of the month of the preceding quarter (for example, assessments as of April 1are used to establish the CMI needed to establish rates for the quarter beginning July 1st). Facility-wide CMI is calculated based on the most recent IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 258 Page 52 assessment for all residents in the nursing facility. The CMI is recalculated quarterly and each nursing facility's rate is adjusted accordingly. A facility-wide CMI is also established each year by averaging four (4) calendar quarter CMIs for the cost reporting period from historical data to represent each fiscal quarter in the cost reporting period (for example, an October 1 CMI would represent the fiscal quarter ended September 30th). (3-19-07) 02. Applicable Cost Data. The cost data used in establishing the cost components of the rate calculation are from the audited or unaudited cost report which ended during the previous calendar year (for example, cost reports ending during the period from January 1, 1998 - December 31, 1998 are used in setting rates effective July 1, 1999). The draft audit of a cost report submitted by a facility will be issued by the Department no later than five (5) months after the date all information required for completion of the audit is filed with the Department. (3-19-07) 03. Interim Rates. Nursing facilities with unaudited cost reports are given an interim rate established by the Department until a rate is calculated based on an audited cost report. When audited data are available, a retroactive adjustment to the payment rate is made through the calculation of the finalized rate. (3-19-07) 04. Direct Care Cost Component. The direct care cost component of a nursing facility's rate is determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. The direct care per diem cost limit applicable to the rate period for a nursing facility type (freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facility, rural hospital-based nursing facility, free-standing and urban hospital-based behavioral care unit, or rural hospital-based behavioral care unit) is identified. The identified direct care cost limit is divided by the statewide average CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period to derive the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit. (4-4-13) b. The adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is compared to the nursing facility's inflated direct care per diem costs. The lower of the two (2) amounts is then case mix adjusted. (3-19-07) i. If the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is lower, the adjusted limit is divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) ii. If the inflated direct care per diem costs are lower, these costs, minus raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs, are divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, then multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period. Raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs are then added back to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) 05. Indirect Care Cost Component. The indirect care cost component of a facility's rate is the lesser of the facility's inflated indirect care per diem costs, or the indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider -- freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care unit nursing facility providers, or rural hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care unit nursing facility providers.

(4-4-13) 06. Costs Exempt From Limitation. Costs exempt from cost limits are property taxes, property insurance, utilities and costs related to new legal mandates as defined in Section 264 of these rules. (3-19-07) 07. Property Reimbursement. The property reimbursement component is calculated in accordance with Section 275 and Subsection 240.19 of these rules. (3-19-07) 08. Revenue Offset. Revenues from products or services provided to nonpatients will be offset from the corresponding rate component(s) as described in Section 257 of this rule. (4-4-13) 258. NURSING FACILITY: COST LIMITS BASED ON COST REPORT. Each July 1st cost limitations will be established for nursing facilities based on the most recent audited cost report with an end date of June 30th of the previous year or before. Calculated limitations will be effective for a one (1) year period, from July 1 through June 30th of each year, which is the rate year. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, the direct and indirect cost limits were calculated using the most recent audited cost reports adjusted to IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 259 Page 53 the midpoint of the cost reporting year’s end in calendar year 2010, to allow for no inflation to the rate year. For rate years beginning July 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the direct and indirect cost limits will be calculated using the most recent audited cost reports adjusted to the midpoint of each provider's cost reporting year that is used to set the July 1 rate, to allow for no inflation to the rate year. (4-4-13) 01. Percentage Above Bed-Weighted Median. (4-4-13) a. Prior to establishing the first “shadow rates” at July 1, 1999, the estimated Medicaid payments under the previous retrospective system for the year period from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will be calculated. This amount will then be used to model the estimated payments under the case mix system set forth in Sections 255 through 257 of these rules. The percentages above the bed-weighted median, for direct and indirect costs, will be established at a level that approximates the same amount of Medicaid expenditures as would have been produced by the retrospective system. The percentages will also be established to approximate the same distribution of total Medicaid dollars between the hospital-based and freestanding nursing facilities as existed under the retrospective system. (4-4-13) b. Once the percentage is established, it will be used to calculate the limit by multiplying the bedweighted median per diem direct cost times the calculated percentage for that class of provider. There will be a direct and indirect percentage that is applied to freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities, and a higher direct and indirect percentage that is applied to rural hospital-based nursing facilities. (4-4-13) c. Beginning with rates effective October 1, 2012, additional direct care cost limit categories will be added for free-standing and urban hospital-based behavioral care units and rural hospital-based behavioral care units. Percentages previously established for other provider class types not considered a behavioral care unit will remain unchanged. Once established, these percentages will remain in effect for future rate setting periods. (4-4-13) 02. Direct Cost Limits. The direct cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be normalized and arrayed from high to low, with all nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (4-4-13) 03. Indirect Cost Limits. The indirect cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be arrayed, with all nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (4-4-13) 04. Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits. Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits will be determined by the limitations calculated in the most recent base year, indexed forward each year from the midpoint of",

Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits. Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits will be determined by the limitations calculated in the most recent base year, indexed forward each year from the midpoint of the base year to the midpoint of the rate year by the inflation factor plus one percent (1%) per annum. The calculated direct and indirect cost limits will not be allowed to decrease below the limitations effective in the base year. The maximum rate of growth on the cost limits, and the minimum cost limitation, will be examined by the oversight committee periodically to determine which factors to use in the calculation of the limitations effective in the new base year and forward. (3-29-10) 05. Costs Exempt From Limitations. Costs exempt from limitations include property taxes, property insurance, and utilities. These costs will be reimbursed on a per diem basis and will not be included in the calculation of the direct or indirect care component. However, property taxes and property insurance will be subject to minimum occupancy levels as defined in Section 278 of these rules. (3-19-07) 259. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW BEDS. Facilities that add beds after July 1, 1999, will have their reimbursement rate subjected to an additional limitation for the next three (3) years. This limitation will apply beginning with the first rate setting period which utilizes a cost report that includes the date when the beds were added. (3-19-07) 01. Limitation of Facilities Rate. The facility's rate will be limited to the bed-weighted average of the following two (2) rates: (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 260 Page 54 a. The facility's current prospective rate calculated in accordance with Section 257 of these rules; and (3-19-07) b. The current median rate for nursing facilities of that type, free-standing, rural hospital-based, or urban hospital-based, established each July 1st. (3-19-07) 02. Calculation of the Bed-Weighted Average. The current calculated facility rate is multiplied by the number of beds in existence prior to the addition. The median rate is multiplied by the number of added beds, weighted for the number of days in the cost reporting period for which they were in service. These two (2) amounts are added together and divided by the total number of beds, with the new beds being weighted if they were only in service for a portion of the year. The resulting per diem amount represents an overall limitation on the facility's reimbursement rate. Providers with calculated rates that do not exceed the limitation receive their calculated rate. (3-19-07) 03. Exception to New Bed Rate. The following situations will not be treated as new beds for reimbursement purposes: (3-19-07) a. Any beds converted from nursing facility beds to assisted living beds, can be converted back to nursing facility beds within three (3) years and not be classified as new nursing facility beds. When a nursing facility bed has been converted to an assisted living bed for three (3) or more concurrent years and the bed is converted back to a nursing facility bed, it must be treated as a new nursing facility bed. (3-19-07) b. Beds added as a result of expansion plans, which the Department was aware of prior to July 1, 1999, will not be treated as new beds. The facility must have already expended significant resources on the purchase of land, site planning, site utility planning, and development. The existence of adequate land or space at the nursing facility does not by itself constitute a significant expenditure of resources for the purposes of expansion. A written request with adequate supporting documentation for an exception under this provision must have been received by the Department no later than December 31, 1999. In no case will beds added after July 1, 2003, qualify for this exception to the new bed criteria. (3-19-07) c. Beds which are decertified as a requirement of survey and certification due to deficiencies at the facility can be re-certified as existing beds with the approval of the Department. (3-19-07) d. When a facility can demonstrate to the Department that adding beds is necessary to meet the needs of an under served area, these beds will not be treated as new beds. For an existing facility the new beds are reimbursed at the same reimbursement rate for that facility's existing beds. For a new facility, the reimbursement rate",

When a facility can demonstrate to the Department that adding beds is necessary to meet the needs of an under served area, these beds will not be treated as new beds. For an existing facility the new beds are reimbursed at the same reimbursement rate for that facility's existing beds. For a new facility, the reimbursement rate is negotiated with the Department. (3-19-07) 260. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW FACILITIES. Facilities constructed subsequent to July 1, 1999, will be reimbursed at the median rate for skilled care facilities of that type (freestanding or hospital-based) for the first three (3) full years of operation. During the period of limitation, the facility's rate will be modified each July 1st to reflect the current median rate for skilled care facilities of that type. After the first three (3) full years, the facility will have its rate established at the next July 1st with the existing facilities in accordance with Section 257 of this rule. (3-19-07) 261. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. New providers resulting from a change in ownership of an existing facility will receive the previous owner's rate until such time as the new owner has a cost report which qualifies for the rate setting criteria established under these rules. If the Department determines that such a facility is operationally or financially unstable, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for the facility. (5-8-09) 262. NURSING FACILITY: OUT-OF-STATE NURSING HOMES. The Idaho Medicaid Program will reimburse for out-of-state nursing home placements when services are not available in Idaho to meet the participant's medical need, or in a temporary situation for a limited period of time required to safely transport the participant to an Idaho facility. Reimbursement for out-of-state nursing homes will be at the per diem rate set by the Medicaid Program in the state where the nursing home is located. Special rates will be allowed according to Section 270 of these rules. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 263 Page 55 263. NURSING FACILITY: DISTRESSED FACILITY. 01. Determination. If the Department determines that a facility is located in an under-served area, or addresses an under-served need, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for that facility. (5-8-09) 02. Discretionary Factors. The fact that a facility may be located in an under-served area or meets an under-served need does not guarantee increased reimbursement. In exercising its discretion to apply a higher rate, the Department will consider the factors as described in Subsections 263.02.a. through 263.02.e. of this rule. (5-8-09) a. Prudent Spending Patterns. The facility has exercised prudent spending and cost allocation practices, as evidenced by a thorough and comprehensive review of the facility’s accounts by the Department. (5-8-09) b. Reasonable Attempts to Remedy Problems. The facility must persuade the Department that it has conscientiously and diligently attempted to cover its costs of care, hire qualified staff and otherwise operate effectively and efficiently, but for causes beyond the facility’s reasonable control, it has not been able to do so. (5-8-09) c. Facility Already Receives Special Rates. When a facility already receives special rates for certain difficulty-of-care patients from the Department, the same costs of care that were used to determine special rates will not be applied toward a determination of distressed facility status, because the special rate meets that need. (5-8-09) d. Direct and Indirect Costs of Care Apportioned to Patient Care. The Department reimburses the costs of patient care, and does not pay for indirect costs not associated with patient care. The determination of distressed status will focus on whether the facility’s distress stems from patient care costs, or whether the distress arises from expenses unrelated to patient care costs. (5-8-09) e. Existing Cost Limits.Under no circumstances may a facility’s reimbursement exceed the lower of its actual costs or customary charge to private-pay patients, as required by federal law, subject to the exceptions in federal law. The Department’s cost caps can be exceeded through the distressed facility process, but to an amount no greater than the federal upper payment limit. (5-8-09) 03. Annual Review. Distressed facility payments are assumed to be short-term in nature. Each distressed payment must be re-requested and re-justified for each subsequent fiscal year that the facility desires the distressed facility rate. (5-8-09) 04. Prospective Application. Distressed facility status will be applied only to facilities that are currently distressed or entering a period of distress. Distressed facility status",

(5-8-09) 264. NURSING FACILITY: INTERIM ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES AS A RESULT OF NEW MANDATES. Certain costs may be excluded from the cost limit calculations, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rates as provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: (3-19-07) 01. Changes of More Than Fifty Cents Per Patient Day in Costs. Changes of more than fifty cents ($.50) per patient day in costs otherwise subject to the cost limitations incurred by a facility as a result of changes in state or federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cost report until such time as they can be properly reflected in the cost limits. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 265 Page 56 a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. These costs will be reported separately and will not be reimbursed through the rate setting process until the costs are fully represented in the cost data used to establish the cost limitations and rates. (3-19-07) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule changes, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. (3-19-07) c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department states otherwise. (3-19-07) 02. Interim Rate Adjustments. For interim rate purposes, the provider may be granted an increase in its prospective rate to cover such cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may be required with justification for the increased costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be determined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. (3-19-07) 03. Future Treatment of Costs. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were first required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases in the calculation of costs subject to the cost center limits. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cost limits until these costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated into the data base used to project the cost limits. When cost increases which have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cost limits, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount included in the index is identified. When the cost limits are set to include previously excluded amounts, any adjustments made to the indices related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. (3-19-07) 265. NURSING FACILITY: MDS REVIEWS. The following Minimum Data Set (MDS) reviews will be conducted: (3-19-07) 01. Facility Review. Subsequent to the picture date, each facility will be sent a copy of its resident roster (a listing of residents, their RUG classification, case mix index, and identification as Medicaid or other). It will be the facility's responsibility at that time to review the roster for accuracy. If the roster is accurate, the facility will sign and return the roster for rate setting. If any errors are detected, those errors will be communicated to the Department in writing along with any supporting documentation. If the signed resident roster is not returned and no errors are communicated to the Department, the original resident roster will be used for rate setting. Once the resident roster has been used for rate setting, it will be considered final unless modified by subsequent Departmental review. (3-19-07) 02. Departmental Review. If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an incorrect case mix index,",

Once the resident roster has been used for rate setting, it will be considered final unless modified by subsequent Departmental review. (3-19-07) 02. Departmental Review. If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an incorrect case mix index, the provider's rate will be retroactively adjusted, for all quarters containing the incorrect assessment, and an amount due to or from the Department will be calculated. This does not include residents who received the default classification due to incomplete or inconsistent MDS data. (3-19-07) 266. NURSING FACILITY: BEHAVIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU) AND RATE STRUCTURE. Effective October 1, 2012, the additional direct care costs associated with BCU residents will remain in direct care costs subject to the direct care cost limitation. Those qualifying BCU nursing facility providers may have a direct care cost limitation higher than non-BCU nursing facility providers. BCU nursing facility providers will not receive an increased indirect care cost limitation. (4-4-13) 01. Determination. The BCU must have a qualifying program and have been providing care in the BCU to behavior residents as of July 1, 2011. Nursing facility providers that meet the BCU criteria will have BCU direct care costs included in direct care costs subject to the cost limit. The direct care cost limitation may be higher than a non-BCU nursing facility. (4-4-13) 02. BCU Routine Customary Charge. If the cost to operate a BCU is included in a nursing facility's rate calculation, the nursing facility must report its usual and customary charge for semi-private rooms in both the BCU and general nursing facility. A weighted average routine customary charge is computed to represent the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 266 Page 57 composite of all Medicaid nursing facility residents in the nursing facility based on the type of rooms they occupy, including the BCU. (4-4-13) 03. Prospective Rate Setting. Beginning October 1, 2012, the direct care cost limit calculation for any special rate revenue offsets in the prior year related to one-to-one (1:1) staffing ratios, BCU, or increased staffing, will be reversed before calculating the cost limit. This revenue offset reversal excludes revenues related to special rate add-ons for ventilator-dependent or tracheostomy services. Rates will be calculated using the cost report ended in the calendar year prior to each July 1 rate setting period with the BCU's direct care costs included in direct care costs subject to the higher BCU cost limit. (4-4-13) 04. Rates Effective October 1, 2012. For rates effective October 1, 2012, a nursing facility designated as a BCU during each nursing facility provider's cost report ended in calendar year 2011 must be identified. (4-4-13) a. Days approved for a BCU during the 2011 cost report year must be identified. (4-4-13) b. To qualify as a BCU, Medicaid BCU days identified in Subsection 266.04.a. of this rule, are divided by total days in the nursing facility and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimum of fifteen percent (15%). (4-4-13) 05. Annual Rates Beginning July 1, 2013. For annual rates beginning July 1, 2013, once a rate has been set as provided in Subsection 266.03 of this rule, the following process will be used to determine BCU eligibility. A nursing facility must apply for BCU eligibility on an annual basis. Eligibility is determined by: (4-4- 13) a. BCU days, regardless of payer source, are divided by the total occupied days in the nursing facility and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimum of twenty percent (20%). (4-4-13) b. The BCU nursing facility provider must provide a list of all residents they believe were qualified for BCU status for the previous year; (4-4-13) i. The Department will select a sample of Idaho Medicaid participants from the submitted list. The nursing facility provider must send the MDS for each selected sample participant, along with related census information, and other requested information to the Department. (4-4-13) ii. The Department will review this information to determine that the participants meet the requirements of Subsection 266.06 of this rule and calculate the percentage of BCU days to the total occupied days in the facility to determine whether the facility meets the BCU eligibility requirement in Subsection 266.05.a. of this rule. (4-4-13) 06. Participant Characteristics. All participants in a BCU must meet the criteria for nursing facility level of care, and have the following characteristics as provided in the participants’ MDS assessment: (4-4-13) a.

The direct care cost limit will be adjusted down to that of the nonBCU nursing facility. (4-4-13) 270. NURSING FACILITY: SPECIAL RATES. A special rate consists of a facility's daily reimbursement rate for a patient plus an add-on amount. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides authority for the Department to pay facilities an amount in addition to the daily rate when a patient has needs that are beyond the scope of facility services and when the cost of providing for those additional needs is not adequately reflected in the rates calculated. This special rate add-on amount for such specialized care is in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provisions of this chapter and is excluded from the computation of payments or rates under other provisions in these rules. (4-4-13) 01. Determination. The Department determines to approve a special rate on a patient-by-patient basis. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 271 Page 61 No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is available from a non-Medicaid source. A special rate request must be based on an identified condition that will continue for a period greater than thirty (30) days. (3-4-11) 02. Effective Date. Upon approval, a special rate is effective on the date the application was received. (3-4-11) 03. Reporting. Costs equivalent to payments for special rate add-on amounts must be removed from the cost components subject to limits, and be reported separately by the provider. (3-19-07) 04. Limitation. A special rate cannot exceed the provider's charges to other patients for similar services. (3-19-07) 05. Prospective Rate Treatment. Prospective treatment of special rates became effective July 1, 2000. Subsections 270.06 and 270.07 of this rule provide clarification of how special rates are paid under the prospective payment system. (4-4-13) 06. Determination of Payment for Qualifying Residents. Special rate add-on amounts are calculated using one (1) of the methods described in Subsections 270.06.a. through 270.06.c. of this rule. (4-4-13) a. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility Existing July 1, 2000. If on July 1, 2000, an entire facility was a special care unit which included Medicaid residents, the facility's direct care cost per diem will not be subject to the direct care cost limit. However, the direct care costs are case mix adjusted based on the ratio of the facility's Medicaid CMI for the rate period to the facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period. (3-19-07) b. Equipment and Non-Therapy Supplies. Equipment and non-therapy supplies not addressed in Section 225 of these rules as determined by the Department, are reimbursed in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.09, “Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits,” Section 755, as an add-on amount. (4-4-13) c. Ventilator Dependent Residents and Residents Receiving Tracheostomy Care. In the case of residents who are ventilator-dependent and who receive tracheostomy care, the special add-on amount to the facility's rate for approved residents receiving this care, is determined by combining the following two (2) components: (4-4-13) i. Calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, for additional direct care staff required in meeting the exceptional needs of these residents. The hourly add-on rate is equal to the current WAHR CNA or current WAHR RN wage rate plus a benefits allowance based on annual cost report data, then weighted to remove the CNA minimum daily staffing time adjusted for the appropriate skill level of care staff; and (4-4-13) ii. Calculation of an add-on for equipment and non-therapy supplies following the provisions in Subsection 270.06.b. of this rule. (4-4-13) 07. Treatment of the Special Rate Cost for Future Rate Setting Periods. Special rates are established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facility rate. When the cost report used to set a prospective rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to “offset,” or reduce costs by an amount equal to total",

When the cost report used to set a prospective rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to “offset,” or reduce costs by an amount equal to total incremental revenues, or add-on payments received by the provider during the cost reporting period. The amount received is calculated by multiplying the special rate add-on amount paid for each qualifying resident by the number of days that were paid. No related adjustment is made to the facility's CMIs. (4-4-13) 08. Special Rate for Providers that Change Ownership or Close. When a facility changes ownership or closes, a closing cost report is not required. Special rate payments made in the closing cost reporting period may be reviewed by the Department. (4-4-13) 271. NURSING FACILITY: OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. The Director will appoint an oversight committee to monitor implementation of the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for nursing facility reimbursement. The committee will be made up of at least one (1) member representing each of the following organizations: the Department, the state associations representing free standing skilled care facilities, and the state associations representing hospital-based skilled care facilities. The committee will continue to IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 272 Page 62 meet periodically subsequent to the implementation of the PPS. (5-8-09) 272. NURSING FACILITY: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS. Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the following: (3-19-07) 01. In General. Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or litigation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfare, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs of which the Medicaid Program will reimburse a portion according to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. (3-19-07) 02. Administrative Appeals. In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appeal the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider’s legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that the provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07) 03. Other. All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in actions against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07) 273. NURSING FACILITY: PATIENT FUNDS. The safekeeping of patient funds, under the program, is the responsibility of the provider. Accordingly, the administration of these funds requires scrupulous care in recording all transactions for the patient. (3-19-07) 01. Use. Generally, funds are provided for personal needs of the patient to be used at the patient's discretion. The provider agrees to manage these funds and render an accounting but may not use them in any way. (3-19-07) 02. Provider Liability. The provider is subject to legal and financial liabilities for committing any of the following acts. This is only a partial listing of the acts contrary to federal regulations: (3-19-07) a. Management fees may not be charged for managing patient trust funds. These charges constitute double payment as management is normally performed by an employee of the provider and their salary is included in reasonable cost reimbursement. (3-19-07) b. Nothing is to be deducted from these funds, unless such deductions are authorized by the patient or his agent in writing. (3-19-07) c. Interest accruing to patient funds on deposit is the property of the patients and is part of the personal funds of each patient. The interest from these funds is not available to the provider for any use, including patient benefits. (3-19-07) 03. Fund Management. Proper management of such funds would include the following as minimum: (3-19-07) a. Savings accounts, maintained separately from facility funds. (3-19-07) b. An accurate system of supporting receipts and disbursements to patients. (3-19-07) c. Written authorization for all deductions. (3-19-07) d. Signature verification. (3-19-07) e. Deposit of all",

Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be limited based on the schedule in this section. (3-19-07) 01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation. The following schedule will be used in determining the maximum amount of owner administrative compensation allowable for the calendar year ending December 31, 2002. (3-19-07) 02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule. The administrative compensation schedule in this Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in average hourly earnings in nursing and personal care facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its successor organization or, if unavailable, another nationally recognized forecasting firm. (3-19-07) 03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation. The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedule in Subsection 274.01 of these rules. Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, all licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, regardless of whether they are in the same facility. (3-19-07) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, the amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limit for allowable compensation. (3-19-07) c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate allowable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one (51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative services may be performed by the owner and will be allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To be allowable, hours for each type of service will be documented. In no event will the total compensation for administrative and non-administrative duties paid to an owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 274.01 of these rules. (3-19-07) Licensed Bed Range Upper limit 51 - 100 86,951 101 - 150 95,641 151 - 250 129,878 251 - up 186,435 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 64 04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner. Compensation for persons related to an owner will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. (3-19-07) 05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider. When an owner provides services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be distributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for non-owners. (3-19-07) 06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensation for Hours Actually Worked. Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary. Total compensation must be reasonable, and not greater than the amount for which the same services could be obtained on the open market. The standard by which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand eighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of this chapter, and will not exceed the compensation determined from the Administrative Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Schedule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080).

(3-19-07) 275. NURSING FACILITY: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. Free standing nursing facilities other than hospital based nursing facilities will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes and property insurance will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate includes compensation for major movable equipment but not for minor movable equipment. The property rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. Prior to final audit for free-standing nursing facilities, an interim rate for property reimbursement will be set to approximate the property rental rate as determined by Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code. (3-19-07) 01. Property Rental Rate. The property rental rate is based upon current construction costs, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to Section 275.01 of these rules, and, beginning April 1, 1985, will be: (3-19-07) R = “Property Base” x 40 - “Age” / 40 x “change in building costs” where: (3-19-07) a. “R” = the property rental rate. (3-19-07) b. “Property Base” = thirteen dollars and nineteen cents ($13.19) beginning October 1, 1996 for all freestanding nursing facilities. (3-19-07) c. “Change in building costs” = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. Beginning January 1, 1997, “change in building costs” will be adjusted each calendar year to reflect the reported annual change in the building cost index for a class D building in the western region, as published by the Marshall Swift Valuation Service or the consumer price index for renter’s costs whichever is greater. For freestanding nursing facilities, the index available in September of the prior year will be used. (3-19-07) d. “Age” of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from the year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30) years, however: (3-19-07) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to document that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set at thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building permits, tax assessors’ records, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be determined for each building. A weighted average using the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large enough to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more years according to the following formula: (3-19-07) r = A x E / S x C IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 65 Where: If the result of this calculation, “r” is equal to or greater than 2.0, the age of the building in years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). (3-19-07) ii. Historical nursing home construction cost per square foot for purposes of evaluating facility age. (3-19-07) iii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation of a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the formula in Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the point where the increase in the property rental rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate “r” for a new facility at the time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before the",

It is the provider’s responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation of costs. (3-19-07) iv. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requirements as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed.

(3-19-07) 04. Sale of a Facility. In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, the buyer will receive the property rental rate of Subsection 275.01 of these rules, except in the event of a forced sale or except in the event of a first sale of a facility receiving a “grandfathered rate” after June 30, 1991, whereupon the property rental rate of the new owner will be computed as if no sale had taken place. (3-19-07) 05. Forced Sale of a Facility. In the event of a forced sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, where the seller has been receiving a grandfathered rate, the buyer will receive a rate based upon his incurred property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for the twelve (12) months following the sale, divided by the facility’s total patient days for that period, or the property rental rate, not modified by Section 275 of these rules, whichever is higher, but not exceeding the rate that would be due the seller. (3-19-07) 276. -- 277. (RESERVED) 278. NURSING FACILITY: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid patients in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occupancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the property rental rate; however adjustment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07) 01. Occupancy Levels. If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eighty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not including cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property costs and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowable fixed costs. (3-19-07) 02. Occupancy Adjustment. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity will be computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for nonroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupancy will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capacity for a new facility will be based on the number of beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capacity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. (3-19-07) 03. Fixed Costs. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be considered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categories. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 279 Page 68 04. Change in Designed Capacity. In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the change and subsequent to the change will be computed and each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capacity is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months following their licensure. (3-19-07) 05. New Facility. In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, the first six (6) months occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07) 279. NURSING FACILITY: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION.

In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, the first six (6) months occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07) 279. NURSING FACILITY: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION. Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has been reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an amount in excess of their net book value, depreciation so reimbursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. (3-19-07) 01. Amount Recaptured. Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a depreciated facility takes place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the first five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciation taken. (3-19-07) 02. Time Frame. Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years from the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the total amount being recaptured for each year after such date. (3-19-07) 280. NURSING FACILITY: REPORTING SYSTEM. The objective of the reporting requirements is to provide a uniform system of periodic reports which will allow: (3-19-07) 01. Basis for Reimbursement. A basis of provider reimbursement approximating actual costs. (3-19-07) 02. Disclosure. Adequate financial disclosure. (3-19-07) 03. Statistical Resources. Statistical resources, as a basis for measurement of reasonable cost and comparative analysis. (3-19-07) 04. Criteria. Criteria for evaluating policies and procedures. (3-19-07) 281. NURSING FACILITY: REPORTING SYSTEM PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION. The provider will be required to file mandatory annual cost reports. (3-19-07) 01. Cost Report Requirements. The fiscal year end cost report filing must include: (3-19-07) a. Annual income statement (two (2) copies); (3-19-07) b. Balance sheet; (3-19-07) c. Statement of ownership; (3-19-07) d. Schedule of patient days; (3-19-07) e. Schedule of private patient charges; (3-19-07) f. Statement of additional charges to residents over and above usual monthly rate; and (3-19-07) g.

(3-19-07) 04. Preparer. It is not required that any statement be prepared by an independent, licensed or certified public accountant. (3-19-07) 05. Reporting by Chain Organizations or Related Party Providers. PRM, Section 2141.7, prohibits the filing of combined or consolidated cost reports as a basis for cost reimbursement. Each facility so related must file a separate set of reports. These cost reports will be required for each level of organization that allocates expenses to the provider. Consolidated financial statements will be considered supplementary information and are not acceptable as fulfilling the primary reporting requirements. (3-19-07) 06. Change of Management or Ownership. To properly pay separate entities or individuals when a change of management or ownership occurs, the following requirements must be met: (3-19-07) a. Outgoing management or administration must file an adjusted-period cost report if they are being reimbursed on a retrospective basis at the time of the charge. This report must meet the criteria for annual cost reports, except that it must be filed not later than sixty (60) days after the change in management or ownership for the purpose of computing a final program settlement. (3-19-07) b. The Department may require an appraisal at the time of a change in ownership. (3-19-07) c. Providers who are receiving a new provider rate or being reimbursed on a prospective basis, when the change of management or ownership occurs, will not be required to file a closing cost report.

Requests for such deferrals and reasons therefore must be in writing and should be made prior to the deadline. A written decision will be rendered in writing within ten (10) days. (3-19-07) 284. NURSING FACILITY: FAILURE TO FILE. Failure to submit timely reports may result in a reduction in the interim rate. Failure to file the required cost reports, including required supplemental information, unless a waiver is granted, may result in a reduction of ten percent (10%) in the provider's interim rate(s) the first day of the month following the deadline date. Continued failure to IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 285 Page 70 comply will result in complete payment suspension on the first day of the following month. When suspension or reduction has occurred and the provider has filed the required cost reports, amounts accruing to the provider during the period of suspension or reduction will be restored. Loss of license or certification will result in immediate termination of reimbursement, full scope audit and settlement for the cost period. (3-19-07) 285. NURSING FACILITY: ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. Reports must be filed using the accrual basis and conform with generally accepted accounting principles or within provisions of the guidelines as specified. In any case, the recorded transaction must be capable of verification by Departmental audit. (3-19-07) 286. NURSING FACILITY: AUDITS.

(3-19-07) 455. HOSPICE: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. All services must be performed by appropriately qualified personnel, but it is the nature of the service, rather than the qualification of the person who provides it, that determines the category of the service. (3-19-07) 456. HOSPICE: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. With the exception of payment for physician services under Section 458 of these rules, Medicaid reimbursement for hospice care will be made at one (1) of five (5) predetermined rates for each day in which a participant receives the respective type and intensity of the services furnished under the care of the hospice. The five (5) rates are prospective rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the “cap” on overall payments, the service intensity add-on, and the limitation on payments for inpatient care, if applicable. A description of the payment for each level of care is described in Subsections 456.01 through 456.04 of these rules. (1-1-16)T 01. Routine Home Care. The hospice provider will be paid one (1) of two (2) routine home care rates for each day the patient is in residence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. The rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day. The two-rate payment methodology will result in a higher based payment for days one (1) through sixty (60) of hospice care and a reduced rate for days sixty-one (61) to end-of-care. If a participant leaves hospice care and then later is placed back on hospice care, regardless of hospice provider, a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services is required in order for the routine home care rate to be paid at the higher base payment rate. If there is not a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services being provided, the hospice provider will be paid at the rate for which the participant is qualified. (1-1-16)T 02. Continuous Home Care. Continuous home care is to be provided only during a period of crisis. A period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires continuous care which is primarily nursing care to achieve palliation and management of acute medical symptoms. Care must be provided by either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8) hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four (24) hour day which begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basis to enable the person to remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. (3-19-07) 03. Inpatient Respite Care. The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day that the participant is in an approved inpatient facility and is receiving respite care. Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subsequent day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine, continuous, or general inpatient rate. (3-19-07) 04. General Inpatient Care. Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the participant receives hospice general inpatient care except as described in Section 458 of these rules. (3-19-07) a. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the patient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (3-19-07) b. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice payment rates are the same as",

When the patient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (3-19-07) b. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice payment rates are the same as the Medicare hospice rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medicare coinsurance amounts. Under the Medicaid hospice benefit, no cost sharing may be imposed with respect to hospice services rendered to Medicaid participants. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 457 Page 109 c. Obligation of continuing care. After the participant’s hospice benefit expires, the patient’s Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must continue to provide that participant’s care until the patient expires or until the participant revokes the election of hospice care. (3-19-07) 05. Service Intensity Add-On. For hospice services with dates of service on and after January 1, 2016, a service intensity add-on payment will be made for a visit by a registered nurse (RN) or social worker when provided in the last seven (7) days of life. Payment for the service intensity add-on is in addition to the routine home care rate and is calculated by multiplying the continuous home care rate per fifteen (15) minutes by the number of units for the combined visits for the day. Payment must not exceed sixteen (16) units per day, and is adjusted for geographic differences in wages. Phone time for a provider's social worker is not eligible for a service intensity add-on payment. (1-1-16)T 457. HOSPICE: LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS FOR INPATIENT CARE. Payments to a hospice for inpatient care must be limited according to the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period beginning November 1st of each year and ending October 31st of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days (both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care) may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid participants during the same period by the designated hospice or its contracted agent(s). (3-19-07) 01. For Purposes of Computation. If it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be paid, any days for which the hospice receives payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations on payment for inpatient days are as follows: (3-19-07) a. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculated by multiplying the total number of a provider’s Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). (3-19-07) b. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospice patients is less than or equal to the maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then no adjustment is made. (3-19-07) c. If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maximum number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then the payment limitation will be determined by: (3-19-07) i. Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care that was made. (3-19-07) ii. Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate. (3-19-07) iii. Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 457.01.c.i. and 457.01.c.ii. of these rules. (3-19-07) iv. Comparing the amount in Subsection 457.01.c.iii. of these rules with interim payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the “cap period.” (3-19-07) 02. The amount by which interim payments for inpatient care exceeds the amount calculated as in Section 459 of these rules is due from the hospice. (3-19-07) 458. HOSPICE: PAYMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES. The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement to the hospice for the costs of all covered services related to the treatment of the participant’s terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under arrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician serving as the medical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include participation in the establishment of plans of care, supervision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these services are included in the reimbursement rates for routine home care, continuous home",

(3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 459 Page 110 01. Hospice Employed Physician Direct Patient Service. Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician’s direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments will be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded. The only physician services to be billed by a hospice for such services are direct patient care services. Laboratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice daily rate. (3-19-07) 02. Volunteer Physician Services. Volunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: (3-19-07) a. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a volunteer physician for specific direct patient care services which are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospice must have a liability to reimburse the physician for those services rendered. In determining whether a service is provided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not distinguish which services are provided voluntarily on the basis of the patient’s ability to pay. (3-19-07) b. Reimbursement for an independent physician’s direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will not be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and they will not be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded. The only services to be billed by an attending physician are the physician’s personal professional services. Costs for services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on the attending physician’s billed charges to the Medicaid program. The aforementioned charges are included in the daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of the hospice. (3-19-07) 459. HOSPICE: CAP ON OVERALL REIMBURSEMENT. Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hospice cap period per Subsection 451.05 of these rules. The total payments made for services furnished to Medicaid participants during this period will be compared to the “cap amount” for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (3-19-07) 01. Overall Cap. The overall cap will be compared to reimbursement after the inpatient limitation is computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospice. (3-19-07) 02. Total Payment for Services. Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid participants during this period means all payments for services rendered during the cap year, regardless of when payment is actually made. (3-19-07) 03. Calculation of Cap Amount. The “cap amount” is calculated by multiplying the number of participants electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500). This amount will be adjusted for each subsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to reflect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be adjusted as per Subsection 459.07 of these rules. (3-19- 07) 04. Computation and Application of Cap Amount. The computation and application of the “cap amount” is made by the Department after the end of the cap period. (3-19-07) 05. Report Number of Medicaid Participants. The hospice must report the number of Medicaid participants electing hospice care during the period to the Department. (3-19-07) a. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of the cap period: and (3-19-07) b. If the participant is transferred to a non-certified hospice no payment to the non-certified hospice will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete participant benefit period in their cap amount. (3-19-07) 06. Certified in Mid-Month.

(3-19-07) 07. Adjustment of the Overall Cap. Cap amounts in each hospice’s cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices during a participant’s election period. The proportion of each hospice’s days of service to the total number of hospice days rendered to the participant during their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each hospice’s adjusted cap amount. (3-19-07) a. After each cap period has ended, the Department will calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participating in the Idaho Medicaid Program. (3-19-07) b. Each hospice’s cap amount will be computed as follows: (3-19-07) i. The share of the “cap amount” that each hospice is allowed will be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hospice in the “cap period.” (3-19-07) ii. The proportion determined in Section 457 of these rules for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the “cap amount” specified for the “cap period” in which the participant first elected hospice. (3-19- 07) c. The participant must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous year through September 27 of the current cap year in order to be counted as an electing Medicaid participant during the current cap year. (3-19-07) 08. Additional Amount for Nursing Facility Residents. An additional per diem amount will be paid for “room and board” of hospice residents in a certified nursing facility receiving routine or continuous care services. In this context, the term “room and board” includes all assistance in the activities of daily living, in socializing activities, administration of medication, maintaining the cleanliness of a resident’s room, and supervision and assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribed therapies. The additional payments and the related days are not subject to the caps specified in Sections 457 and 459 of these rules. The room and board rate will be ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of service on which the participant was a resident of that facility. (3-19-07) 460. HOSPICE: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where a participant is determined eligible for medical assistance participation in the cost of long term care, the Department must reduce its payments for all costs of the hospice benefit, including the supplementary amounts for room and board, by an amount determined according to Section 227 of these rules.

Prior to receiving developmental disability services as provided in Sections 507 through 719 of these rules, the participant must be determined to have a developmental disability. (3-19-07) 501. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY DETERMINATION STANDARDS: ELIGIBILITY. The definitions and standards in the table below must be used to determine whether a participant meets criteria as a person with a developmental disability under Section 66-402, Idaho Code.

A “substantial” limitation is one in which the total effect of the limitation results in the need for a “combination and sequence of special interdisciplinary, or generic care, treatment or other services that need to be individually planned and coordinated.” Listed below are standards for substantial functional limitations in each major life area. Age 3 through Adult: A score of 2 standard deviations below the mean creates a presumption of a functional limitation. Birth to Age 3: The following criteria must be utilized to determine a substantial functional limitations for children under 3: a. The child scores 30% below age norm; or b. The child exhibits a 6 month delay; or c. The child scores 2 standard deviations below the mean. self care; Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when the person requires physical or non-physical assistance in performing eating, hygiene, grooming, or health care skills, or when the time required for a person to perform these skills him/her self is so substantial as to impair his ability to conduct other activities of daily living or retain employment. Birth to Age 21: A functional limitation is manifest when the child's skills are limited according to age-appropriate responses such that the parent, caregiver, or school personnel is required to provide care that is substantially beyond that typically required for a child of the same age (such as excessive time lifting, diapering, supervision). receptive and expressive language; Age 3 through Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when a person is unable to communicate effectively without the aid of a third person, a person with special skills, or without an assistive device (such as sign language). Birth to Age 3: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when they have been diagnosed by a qualified professional who determines that the child performs 30% below age norm (adjusted for prematurity up to 2 years) or demonstrates at least 2 standard deviations below the mean in either area or 1 1/2 below in both areas of language development. learning; Birth through Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when cognition, retention, reasoning, visual or aural communications, or other learning processes or mechanisms are impaired to the extent that special (interventions that are beyond those that an individual normally needs to learn) intervention is required for the development of social, self care, language, academic, or vocational skills. mobility; Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when fine or gross motor skills are impaired to the extent that the assistance of another person or an assistive device is required for movement from place to place. Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation would be measured by an age appropriate instrument which compares the child's skills for postural control and movement and coordinated use of the small muscles with those skills expected of children of the same age.

(RESERVED) 503. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY DETERMINATION: TEST INSTRUMENTS. A variety of standardized test instruments are available. Tests used to determine a developmental disability must reflect the current functional status of the individual being evaluated. Tests over one (1) year old must be verified to reflect the current status of the individual by an appropriate professional. Instruments designed only for screening purposes must not be used to determine eligibility. (3-19-07) 01. Test Instruments For Adults. Unless contra-indicated, the following test instruments or self-direction; Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when a person requires assistance in managing his personal finances, protecting his self interest, or making decisions that may affect his well being. Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation is manifest when the child is unable to help his self or cooperate with others age appropriate assistance to meet personal needs, learn new skills, follow rules, and adapt to environments. capacity for independent living; or Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when, for a person's own safety or well-being, supervision or assistance is required, at least on a daily basis, in the performance of health maintenance, housekeeping, budgeting, or leisure time activities and in the utilization of community resources. Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation would be measured by an ageappropriate instrument which compares the child's personal independence and social responsibility expected of children of comparable age and cultural group. economic self-sufficiency; and Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when a person is unable to perform the tasks necessary for regular employment or is limited in productive capacity to the extent that his earned annual income, after extraordinary expenses occasioned by the disability, is insufficient for self-support. Age 5 to Age 21: Use the pre-vocational area of a standardized functional assessment to document a limitation in this area. Birth to Age 5: A substantial limitation in this area is evidenced by the child's eligibility for SSI, early intervention, or early childhood special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). AND (c) reflects the needs for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary or generic care, treatment or other services which are of life-long or extended duration and individually planned and coordinated. Age 5 through Adult: Life-long or extended duration means the developmental disability is one which has the reasonable likelihood of continuing for a protracted period of time, including a reasonable likelihood that it will continue throughout life. Birth to Age 5: The expected duration may be frequently unclear. Therefore, determination of eligibility by a multi-disciplinary team for early intervention services through SSI, an IFSP, child study team or early childhood special education services through an IEP will be an indicator of this criteria.

Using these specific participant factors, the budget-setting methodology will correlate a participant's characteristics with the participant's individualized budget amount, so participants with higher needs will be assigned a higher individualized budget amount. (3-29-12) a. The Department notifies each participant of his set budget amount as part of the eligibility determination process or annual redetermination process. The notification will include how the participant may appeal the set budget amount. (3-29-12) b. Individualized budgets will be re-evaluated annually. At the request of the participant, the Department will also re-evaluate the set budget amount when there are documented changes in the participant's condition resulting in a need for services that meet medical necessity criteria, and this is not reflected on the current inventory of individual needs. (3-29-12) 02. Residential Habilitation - Supported Living Acuity-Based Levels of Support. Reimbursement for residential habilitation - supported living is based on the participant's assessed level of support need. All plans of service that include supported living must include community integration goals that provide for maintained or enhanced independence, quality of life, and self-determination. As a participant’s independence increases and he is less dependent on supports, he must transition to less intense supports. (3-19-07) a. High support is for those participants who require twenty-four (24) hour per day supports and supervision and have an SIB-R Support Level of Pervasive, Extensive, or Frequent. High support allows for a blend of one-to-one and group staffing. Participants authorized at the high support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These services are included in the high support daily rate. (3-19-07) b. Intense support is for those exceptional participants who require intense, twenty-four (24) hour per day supports and supervision. This support level typically requires one-on-one staffing, but requests for a blend of one-on-one and group staffing will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Participants authorized at the intense support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These services are included in the intense support daily rate. To qualify for this level of support, participants must be evaluated to meet one or more of the following criteria: (3-19-07) i. Recent felony convictions or charges for offenses related to the serious injury or harm of another person. These participants must have been placed in a supported living setting directly from incarceration or directly after being diverted from incarceration. (3-19-07) ii. History of predatory sexual offenses and are at high risk to re-offend based on a sexual offender risk assessment completed by an appropriate professional. (3-19-07) iii. Documented, sustained history of serious aggressive behavior showing a pattern of causing harm to themselves or others. The serious aggressive behavior must be such that the threat or use of force on another person makes that person reasonably fear bodily harm. The participant must also have the capability to carry out such a threat. The frequency and intensity of this type of aggressive behavior must require continuous monitoring to prevent injury to themselves or others. (3-19-07) iv. Chronic or acute medical conditions that are so complex or unstable that one-to-one staffing is required to provide frequent interventions and constant monitoring. Without this intervention and monitoring the participant would require placement in a nursing facility, hospital, or ICF/ID with twenty-four (24) hour on-site nursing. Verification of the complex medical condition and the need for this level of service requires medical documentation. (3-19-07) c. Hourly support is for those individuals that do not meet criteria for either high or intense supports or those individuals who qualify for a daily rate but whose needs can be met with less than twenty-four (24) per day support. The combination of hourly supported living, developmental therapy, community supported employment, and adult day care will not be authorized to exceed the maximum set daily amount established by the Department except IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 515 Page 123 when all of the following conditions are met: (3-19-07) i.

ADULT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES: QUALITY ASSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENT. 01. Quality Assurance. Quality Assurance consists of audits and reviews to assure compliance with the Department's rules and regulations. If problems are identified during the review or audit, the provider must implement a corrective action plan within forty-five (45) days after the results are received. The Department may terminate authorization of service for providers who do not comply with the corrective action plan. (3-19-07) 02. Quality Improvement. The Department may gather and utilize information from providers to evaluate customer satisfaction, participant satisfaction, outcomes monitoring, care management, quality assurance, quality improvement activities, and health and safety. These findings may lead to quality improvement activities to improve provider processes and outcomes for participants. (3-19-07) 03. Exception Review. The Department will complete an exception review of plans or addendums requesting services that exceed the assigned budget authorized by the assessor. Requests for these services will be authorized when one (1) of the following conditions are met: (4-11-15) a. Services are needed to assure the health and safety of participants who require residential high or intense supported living, and the services requested on the plan or addendum are required based on medical necessity as defined in Subsection 012.14 of these rules. (4-11-15) b. Supported employment services as defined in Section 703 of these rules are needed for the participant to obtain or maintain employment. The request must be submitted on the Department-approved Exception Review Form and is reviewed and approved based on the following: (4-11-15) i. A supported employment service recommendation must be submitted that includes: recommended amount of service, level of support needed, employment goals, and a transition plan. When the participant is transitioned from the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (IDVR) services, the recommendation must be completed by IDVR. When a participant is in an established job, the recommendation must be completed by the supported employment agency identified on the plan of service or addendum; (4-11-15) ii. The participant’s plan of service was developed by the participant and his person-centered planning team and includes a goal for supported employment services. Prior to the submission of an exception review with an addendum, a comprehensive review of all services on the participant’s plan must occur. The participant’s combination of services must support the increase or addition of supported employment services; and (4-11-15) iii. An acknowledgement signed by the participant and his legal guardian, if one exists, that additional budget dollars approved to purchase supported employment services must not be reallocated to purchase any other Medicaid service. (4-11-15) 04. Concurrent Review. The Department will obtain the necessary information to determine that participants continue to meet eligibility criteria, services continue to be clinically necessary, services continue to be the choice of the participant, and services constitute appropriate care to warrant continued authorization or need for the service.

The reasonable level of direct care staffing provided to a participant IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 588 Page 136 in an ICF/ID setting will be dependent upon the level of involvement and the need for services and supports of the participant as determined by the Department.

(3-19-07) 06. Phase-In Period. If enactment of Subsection 587.04 of these rules requires a facility to reduce its level of direct care staffing, a six (6) month phase-in period will be allowed from the date of the enactment of this section, without any resulting disallowances. Should disallowances result, the hourly rate of direct care staff used in determining disallowances will be the weighted average of the hourly rates paid to a facility's direct care staff, plus the associated benefits, at the end of the phase-in period. (3-19-07) 07. Exceptions. Should a provider be able to show convincing evidence documenting that the annual aggregate direct care hours as allowed under this section will compromise their ability to supply adequate care to the participants, as required by federal regulations and state rules, within an ICF/ID residential living unit and that other less costly options would not alleviate the situation, the Department will approve an additional amount of direct care hours sufficient to meet the extraordinary needs. This adjustment will only be available up through September 30, 1996. (3-19-07) 588. ICF/ID: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. 01. Payment Methodology. ICF/ID facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with the methodology listed in Sections 588 through 633 of these rules. (3-19-07) 02. Date of Discharge.

If a Medicaid patient dies in an ICF/ID, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. (3-19-07) 589. ICF/ID: REASONABLE COST PRINCIPLES. To be allowable, costs must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to beneficiaries will result. (3-19-07) 01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles. (3-19-07) a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance with rules found in the Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modified by the exceptions contained herein, is used to identify cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost Report. (3-19-07) i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services, including normal standby costs. (3-19-07) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 590 Page 137 be paid by the program. (3-19-07) b. Costs may vary from one institution to another because of a variety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Chapter 1, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation.

It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Chapter 1, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid to the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and that its actual operating costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or service. (3-19-07) d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers incur, in the absence of clear evidence that the higher costs were unavoidable, the excess costs are not reimbursable. (3-19-07) 02. Costs Related to Patient Care. These include all necessary and proper costs in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs which are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity. They include costs such as depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance costs, administrative costs, costs of employee pension plans, normal standby costs, and others. Example: Depreciation is a method of systematically recognizing the declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the asset is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed based on property costs according to other provisions of this chapter. Property related expenses are likewise allowable. (3-19-07) 03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care. Costs not related to patient care are costs which are not appropriate or necessary and proper in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursable costs. Example: Fines are imposed for late remittance of federal withholding taxes. Such fines are not related to patient care, are not necessary, and are not reflective of prudent cost conscious management. Therefore, such fines and penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07) 04. Form and Substance. Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financial transactions will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the transaction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are contracts which are executed in the form of a lease. The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the property. If a lease contract is found to be in substance a purchase, the related payments are not allowable as lease or rental expense. (3-19-07) 590. ICF/ID: ALLOWABLE COSTS. The following definitions and explanations apply to allowable costs: (3-19-07) 01. Accounts Collection. The costs related to the collection of past due program related accounts, such as legal and bill collection fees, are allowable. (3-19-07) 02. Auto and Travel Expense.

Allowable compensation cannot exceed the amount necessary to attract assistance from parties not related to the owner to perform the same services. The nature and extent of services must be supported by adequate documentation including hours performing the services. Where an average industry wide rate for a particular function can be determined, reported allowable owner compensation cannot exceed the average",

ICF/ID: IDAHO OWNER-ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION. Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be limited based on the schedule in this section. (3-19-07) 01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation. The following schedule will be used in determining the maximum amount of owner administrative compensation allowable for the calendar year ending December 31, 2002. (3-19-07) 02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule. The administrative compensation schedule in this Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in average hourly earnings in nursing and personal care facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its successor organization or, if unavailable, another nationally recognized forecasting firm. (3-19-07) 03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation. The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedule in Subsection 597.01. of these rules. Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, all licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, regardless of whether they are in the same facility. (3-19-07) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, the amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limit for allowable compensation. (3-19-07) c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate allowable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one (51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative services may be performed by the owner and will be Licensed Bed Range Upper limit 51 - 100 86,951 101 - 150 95,641 151 - 250 129,878 251 - up 186,435 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 600 Page 143 allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To be allowable, hours for each type of service will be documented. In no event will the total compensation for administrative and non-administrative duties paid to an owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 597.01 of these rules. (3-19-07) 04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner. Compensation for persons related to an owner will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. (3-19-07) 05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider. When an owner provides services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be distributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for non-owners. (3-19-07) 06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensation for Hours Actually Worked. Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary. Total compensation must be reasonable, and not greater than the amount for which the same services could be obtained on the open market.

(3-19-07) 598. -- 599. (RESERVED) 600. ICF/ID: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid patients in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occupancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the property rental rate; however adjustment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07) 01. Occupancy Levels. If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eighty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not including cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property costs and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowable fixed costs. (3-19-07) 02. Occupancy Adjustment. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity will be computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for nonroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupancy will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capacity for a new facility will be based on the number of beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capacity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. (3-19-07) 03. Fixed Costs. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be considered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categories. (3-19-07) 04. Change in Designed Capacity. In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the change and subsequent to the change will be computed and each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capacity is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months following their licensure. (3-19-07) 05. New Facility. In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, the first six (6) months occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07) IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 601 Page 144 601. ICF/ID: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION. Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has been reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an amount in excess of their net book value, depreciation so reimbursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. (3-19-07) 01. Amount Recaptured. Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a depreciated facility takes place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the first five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciation taken. (3-19-07) 02. Time Frame. Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years from the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the total amount being recaptured for each year after such date. (3-19-07) 602. ICF/ID: REPORTING SYSTEM. The objective of the reporting requirements is to provide a uniform system of periodic reports which will allow: (3-19-07) 01. Basis for Reimbursement. A basis of provider reimbursement approximating actual costs. (3-19-07) 02. Disclosure. Adequate financial disclosure. (3-19-07) 03. Statistical Resources.

(3-19-07) 04. Preparer. It is not required that any statement be prepared by an independent, licensed or certified public accountant. (3-19-07) 05. Reporting by Chain Organizations or Related Party Providers. PRM, Section 2141.7, prohibits the filing of combined or consolidated cost reports as a basis for cost reimbursement. Each facility so related must file a separate set of reports. These cost reports will be required for each level of organization that allocates expenses to the provider. Consolidated financial statements will be considered supplementary information and are not acceptable as fulfilling the primary reporting requirements. (3-19-07) 06. Change of Management or Ownership. To properly pay separate entities or individuals when a change of management or ownership occurs, the following requirements will be met: (3-19-07) a.

This report will meet the criteria for annual cost reports, except that it will be filed not later than sixty (60) days after the change in management or ownership. (3-19-07) b. The Department may require an appraisal at the time of a change in ownership. (3-19-07) 07. Reporting Period. When required for establishing rates, new ICF/ID providers will be required to submit cost projections for the first year of operations. Thereafter, the normal reporting period coincides with the provider’s standard fiscal year. If a provider withdraws from the program and subsequently re-enters, the new provider reporting requirements will apply. (3-19-07) 604. (RESERVED) 605. ICF/ID: FILING DATES. 01. Deadlines. Deadlines for annual cost reports will be the last day of the third month following the fiscal year end or the deadline imposed by Medicare if the provider is required to file a Medicare cost report. (3-19-07) 02. Waivers. A delay of thirty (30) days may be granted for annual cost reports in unusual circumstances. Requests for such deferrals and reasons therefore must be in writing and should be made prior to the deadline. A written decision will be rendered in writing within ten (10) days. (3-19-07) 606. ICF/ID: FAILURE TO FILE. Failure to submit timely reports may result in a reduction in the interim rate. Failure to file the required cost reports, including required supplemental information, unless a waiver is granted, may result in a reduction of ten percent (10%) in the provider's interim rate(s) the first day of the month following the deadline date. Continued failure to comply will result in complete payment suspension on the first day of the following month. When suspension or reduction has occurred and the provider has filed the required cost reports, amounts accruing to the provider during the period of suspension or reduction will be restored. Loss of license or certification will result in immediate termination of reimbursement, full scope audit and settlement for the cost period. (3-19-07) 607. ICF/ID: ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

Accordingly, the administration of these funds requires scrupulous care in recording all transactions for the patient. (3-19-07) 01. Use. Generally, funds are provided for personal needs of the patient to be used at the patient's discretion. The provider agrees to manage these funds and render an accounting but may not use them in any way. (3-19-07) 02. Provider Liability. The provider is subject to legal and financial liabilities for committing any of the following acts. This is only a partial listing of the acts contrary to federal regulations: (3-19-07) a.

(RESERVED) 620. ICF/ID: PAYMENTS FOR PERIODS OF TEMPORARY ABSENCE. Payments may be made for reserving beds in ICFs/ID for participants during their temporary absence if the facility charges private paying participants for reserve bed days, subject to the following limitations: (3-19-07) 01. Prior Approval for Absence. Therapeutic home visits for ICF/ID residents of up to thirty-six (36) days per calendar year so long as the days are part of a written treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. Prior approval from the RMS must be obtained for any home visits exceeding fourteen (14) consecutive days. (3-19-07) 02. Limits on Amount of Payments. Payment for reserve bed days will be lesser of the following: (3-19-07) a. One hundred percent (100%) of the audited allowable costs of the facility; or (3-19-07) b. The rate charged to private paying participants for reserve bed days. (3-19-07) 621. ICF/ID: PAYMENT PROCEDURES. Each ICF/ID must submit its claims to the Department in accordance with the procedures established by the Department. The Department will not pay for a claim in behalf of a Participant unless the information on the claim is consistent with the information in the Department's computer eligibility file. (3-19-07) 622. ICF/ID: PRINCIPLE PROSPECTIVE RATES. Providers of ICF/ID facilities will be paid a per diem rate which, with certain exceptions, is not subject to an audit settlement. The per diem rate for a fiscal period will be based on audited historical costs adjusted for inflation. The provider must report these cost items in accordance with other provisions of this chapter or the applicable provisions of PRM consistent with this chapter. Sections 622 through 628 of these rules provide procedures and specifications IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 623 Page 152 necessary to implement the provisions and accomplish the objectives of the payment system for ICF/ID providers. Total payment will include the following components: Property reimbursement, capped costs, exempt costs, and excluded costs. Except as otherwise provided in this section, rates calculated for state fiscal year 2012 (July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012) will be calculated by using finalized cost reports ended in calendar year 2009 with no cost or cost limit adjustments for inflation to the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Rates effective July 1, 2012, and every July 1 thereafter, will be calculated by using audited cost reports ended in the calendar year two (2) years prior to each July 1 (July 1, 2012, rates will use cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 and so forth), with no cost or cost limit adjustments for inflation. (4-4-13) 623. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT. Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID property costs are reimbursed by a rental rate or based on cost. The following will be reimbursed based on cost as determined by the provisions of this chapter and applicable provisions of PRM to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter: ICF/ID living unit property taxes, ICF/ID living unit property insurance, and major movable equipment not related to home office or day treatment services. Reimbursement of other property costs is included in the property rental rate. Any property cost related to home offices and day treatment services are not considered property costs and will not be reported in the property cost portion of the cost report. These costs will be reported in the home office and day treatment section of the cost report. Property costs, including costs which are reimbursed based on a rental rate, will be reported in the property cost portion of the cost report. The Department may require and utilize an appraisal to establish those components of property costs which are identified as an integral part of an appraisal. Property costs include the following components: (3-19-07) 01. Depreciation. Allowable depreciation based on straight line depreciation. (3-19-07) 02. Interest. All allowable interest expense which relates to financing depreciable assets. Interest on working capital loans is not a property cost and is subject to the cap. (3-19-07) 03. Property Insurance.

Costs of related party leases are to be reported in the property cost categories based on the owner's costs. (3-19-07) 624. ICF/ID: CAPPED COST. Beginning October 1, 1996, this cost area includes all allowable costs except those specifically identified as property costs in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. This Section defines items and procedures to be followed in determining allowable and exempt costs and provides the procedures for extracting cost data from historical cost reports, applying a cost forecasting market basket to project cost forward, procedures to be followed to project costs forward, and procedures for computing the median of the range of costs and the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07) 01. Costs Subject to the Cap. Items subject to the cap include all allowable costs except property costs identified in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs identified in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. Property costs related to a home office are administrative costs, will not be reported as property costs, and are subject to the cap. (3-19-07) 02. Per Diem Costs. Costs to be included in this category will be divided by the total participant days for the facility for the cost reporting period to arrive at allowable per diem costs. If costs for services provided some or all non-Medicaid residents are not included in the total costs submitted, the provider must determine the costs and combine them with the submitted costs in order that a total per diem cost for that facility can be determined both for both the purposes of determining the ICF/ID cap and of computing final reimbursement. (3-19-07) 03. Cost Data to Determine the Cap. Cost data to be used to determine the cap for ICF/ID facilities will be taken from each provider's most recent final cost report available sixty (60) days before the beginning of the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 624 Page 153 period for which the cap is being set. Cost reports are final when the final audit report is issued, or earlier if the Department informs the facility the report is final for rate setting purposes. The selected final cost report will be used to establish the facility's prospective reimbursement rate. However, the final cost reports covering a period of less than twelve (12) months will be included in the data for determining the cap at the option of the Department. (3-19-07) 04. Projection. Per diem allowable costs will be inflated forward using a cost forecasting market basket and forecasting indices according to the same table as used for free standing facilities. (3-19-07) a. The projection method used in Section 624 of these rules to set the cap will also be used to set non property portions of the prospective rate which are not subject to the cap. (3-19-07) b. Forecasting indices as developed by Data Resources, Incorporated, will be used unless they are unavailable. In such case, indices supplied by some other nationally recognized forecaster will be used. (3-19-07) 05. Costs Which Can be Paid Directly by the Department to Non ICF/ID Providers. Costs which can be paid directly by the Department to non ICF/ID providers are excluded from the ICF/ID prospective rates and ICF/ID cap: (3-19-07) a. Direct physician care costs. Physicians who provide these services must bill the Medicaid program directly using their own provider numbers. (3-19-07) b. Costs of services covered under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) portion of the Medicaid Program. Items such as eyeglasses and hearing aids are covered under IDAPA 16.03.09, “Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits.” Dental services provided to EPSDT participants who are under the age of twenty-one (21) and who reside in an ICF/ID, are covered under Sections 080 through 085 of these rules. The cost of these services is not includable as a part of ICF/ID costs. Reimbursement can be made",

Costs of services covered by other parts of the Medicaid Program. Examples of these items include legend drugs and ambulance transportation. These items must be billed to the Medicaid Program directly by the provider using his own provider number. (3-19-07) 06. Cost Projection. Allowable per diem costs will be projected forward from the midpoint of the Base Period to the midpoint of the Target Period. “Base Period” is defined as the last available final cost report period. “Target Period” is defined as the effective period of the prospective rate. Procedures for inflating these costs are as follows: (3-19-07) a. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed from the beginning to the end of the Base Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward allowable per diem costs for each cost category from the midpoint to the end of the Base Period. (3-19-07) b. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed for the period from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. These percentages will then be used to project forward the allowable per diem costs for each cost category, as determined in Subsection 624.06.a. of these rules, from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. (3-19-07) c. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed for the beginning to the end of the Target Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward the allowable per diem costs as determined in Subsection 624.06.b. of these rules from the beginning to the midpoint of the Target Period. (3-19-07) 07. Cost Ranking. Prior to October 1st of each year the Director will determine the that percent above the median which will assure aggregate payments to ICF/ID providers will approximate but not exceed amounts that would be incurred using Medicare cost principles of reimbursement. That percentage will apply to caps and rates set after September 30th of each year. Projected per diem costs as determined in this section and subject to the cap will be IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 626 Page 154 ranked from the highest to the lowest. The cap will be set at a percent of the bed-weighted median for each rate period. The initial cap will be set as of October 1, 1996. (3-19-07) a. The median of the range will be computed based on the available data points being considered as the total population of data points. (3-19-07) b. The cap for each ICF/ID facility with a fiscal year beginning October 1, 1996, will be computed prior to the beginning of that year. For those facilities with a fiscal year ending on a date other than September 30th, the first cap will be computed for the period beginning October 1, 1996, and ending on the fiscal year end date. (3-19-07) c. Facilities with cost reports that transcend the period from October 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, will be retrospectively settled using the previous reimbursement system for the period of the report up to September 30, 1996. There will not be a retrospective settlement on the portion of these cost reports attributed to October 1, 1996 through the end of the cost report period unless provisions of Section 626 of these rules apply. (3-19-07) d. Cost reports for periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996, will not be subject to retrospective settlement except as required by other provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07) e. A new cap and rate will be set on an annual basis for each facility the first of July every year. (3-19-07) f. The cap and prospective rate will be determined and set on an annual basis for each facility July first of every year and will not be changed by any subsequent events or information with the exception that",

(3-19-07) g. Payment of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the exclusions found in Section 628 of these rules apply. (3-19-07) h. A facility which commences to offer participant care services as an ICF/ID on or after October 1, 1996, will be subject to retrospective settlement until the first prospective rate is set. Such facility will be subject to the ICF/ID cap as determined in this chapter. The first prospective rate for this provider will be set by the Department based on quarterly cost statements and final cost reports submitted for periods following the first three (3) months of operation. This first prospective rate may be set after the beginning of the second fiscal year of the provider. For the second year the provider will be paid a rate to be settled retrospectively unless both the Department and the provider agree to a prospective rate or rates covering that fiscal period. (3-19-07) 625. (RESERVED) 626. ICF/ID: RETROSPECTIVE SETTLEMENT. When retrospective settlement is applicable, it is based on allowable reimbursement in accordance with this chapter and based on an audit report. Retrospective settlement will be subject to the same caps and limits determined for prospective payments. (3-19-07) 01. A Provider's Failure to Meet Any of the Conditions. A provider's failure to meet any of the conditions of participation set forth in 42 CFR 483, Subpart I, may subject that provider to retrospective reimbursement for the fiscal year, or any portion thereof, during which the condition is not met. The provider's projected per diem rate may be adjusted to reflect actual reimbursable costs subject to cost limits. (3-19-07) 02. A First Time Provider. A first time provider operating a new ICF/ID living unit will be subject to a retrospective settlement for the first fiscal year and until the first subsequent period wherein a prospective rate is set in accordance with Sections 603, 605, and 606 of these rules and this chapter. A budget based on the best available information is required prior to opening for participant care so an interim rate can be set. (3-19-07) 03. New ICF/ID Living Unit. A new ICF/ID living unit for an existing operator is subject to first time IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 627 Page 155 facility requirements if the new living unit reflects a net increase in licensed beds, otherwise the Department may set a prospective rate with the non-property rate components based on similar components of rates most recently paid for the participants moving into the facility. The property rental rate will be set according to applicable provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07) 04. Change of Ownership of Existing ICF/ID Living Unit. Where there is a change of ownership of an existing ICF/ID living unit, the provider operating the ICF/ID living unit will not receive an adjustment of the provider's prospective rate except that the property rental portion of the rate will be adjusted subject to property rental provisions of this chapter. However, new facility reporting requirements and the cap will apply. (3-19-07) 05. Fraudulent or False Claims. Providers who have made fraudulent or false claims are subject to retrospective settlement as determined by the Department. (3-19-07) 06. Excluded Costs. Excluded costs may be retrospectively settled according to the provisions of Section 247 of these rules. (3-19-07) 627. ICF/ID: EXEMPT COSTS. Exempt costs are not subject to the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07) 01. Day Treatment Services. As specified in this Section, the cost of day treatment services may be reimbursed in this category and may not be subject to the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07) a.

(3-19-07) b.

The Department will not reimburse for the cost of services which are paid for or should be paid for by an other agency. (3-19-07) c. When ICF/ID day treatment services are performed for participants in a licensed Developmental Disability Center, the allowable cost of such services will be included in this category, but not more than the amount that would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule for individual or group therapy for similar services. Amounts incurred or paid by the ICF/ID in excess of what would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule for like services are not allowable costs and will be reported as non-reimbursable. (3-19-07) d. For day treatment services provided in a location other than a certified developmental disability center, the maximum amount reportable in this category will also be limited. Total costs for such services reported by each provider in this category will be limited to the number of hours, up to thirty (30) hours per week per participant, of individual or group developmental therapy times the hourly rate that would be paid according to the most recent Department fee schedule for the same services if provided in a developmental disability center. Costs in excess of the limits determined in this Subsection will be classified and reported as subject to the ICF/ID cap. Initial rates established under the prospective system effective October 1, 1996, and not later than October 1, 1997, will not include a limitation of day treatment costs based on the hourly rate, when the hours of individual or group therapy were not obtained or audited by the Department at the time the rate was published. However, if a provider believes that the day treatment cost used to establish the day treatment portion of its prospective rate was misstated for rates set for periods beginning October 1, 1996, through rates beginning October 1, 1997, revisions to the prospective rate may be made to the extent the provider demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Department, that the cost used was misstated. Such a revision will be considered only if the provider requests a revision and provides adequate documentation within sixty (60) days of the date the rate was set. At the option of the Department it may negotiate fixed rates for these day treatment services. Such rates will be set so the aggregate related payments are lower than would be paid with a limitation based on schedules used for licensed Developmental Disability Centers. (3-19-07) e. Financial data including expenses and labor hours incurred by or on behalf of the provider in providing day treatment services, must be identifiable and separate from the costs of other facility operations. Reasonable property costs related to day treatment services and not included in the property rental rate, will be separately identified, will be reported as day treatment services costs, and will not include property costs otherwise IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 628 Page 156 reimbursed. Property costs related to day treatment services will be separately identified as not related to living unit costs by a final audit determination issued prior to October 1, 1996, or will be separate and distinct from any property used for ICF/ID services which are or were day treatment services. (3-19-07) f. In the event a provider has a change in the number of participants requiring day treatment services, the prospective rate may be adjusted by the Department to reflect a change in costs related to such a change. Providers receiving such changes may be required to provide added documentation to the Department to assure that further changes can be identified and the prospective rate adjusted accordingly. (3-19-07) 02. Major Movable Equipment. Costs related to major movable equipment, as defined in this chapter will be exempt from the ICF/ID cap and will be reimbursed prospectively based on Medicare principles of cost reimbursement. (3-19-07) 628. ICF/ID: COSTS EXCLUDED FROM THE CAP.

Certain costs may be excluded from the ICF/ID cap, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rate as provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: (3-19-07) 01. Increases of More Than One Dollar Per Participant Day in Costs. Increases of more than one dollar ($1) per participant day in costs otherwise subject to the cap incurred by a facility as a result of changes in State or Federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cost report for reports filed less than thirty (30) months, or a greater length of time if so directed by the Department, from the date such increases were first required. Such costs will be subdivided into the component parts of wages, benefits, contracted services and other costs in the amounts equal to costs removed from the respective cost categories subject to the cap. The Department may adjust the forecasted rate to include the projected per diem related to such costs. (3-19-07) a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. (3-19-07) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule change, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. (3-19-07) c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department states otherwise. (3-19-07) d. For interim rate purposes the provider's prospective rate may be granted an increase to cover such cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may be required with the justification for the increased costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be determined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. (3-19-07) e. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were first required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases with costs subject to the cap when setting rates or increase the cap and individual facility prospective rates following such cost increases. If a cap is set with these particular costs included in the cap category, providers subject to that cap will not have these costs excluded from the cap for prospective rate purposes. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cap until these costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated in the data base used to project the cap and for these costs to be exempt only when they are not included in the data base. In those cases, when costs are not incurred immediately after a change in rule or law, delays in incorporating the new costs in the cap are warranted. (3-19-07) f. When cost increases which have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cap, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount is included in the index is identified. When the cap is set to include previously excluded amounts, any adjustments previously made to the indexes related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. (3-19-07) 02. Excess Inflation. Reimbursement of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the inflation indices used to set the prospective rates for a reporting period understated actual IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 629 Page 157 inflation by more than seven (7%) percentage points. In such case, prospective rates and the cap will be increased by the amount which actual inflation indices exceeded projected inflation indices and may be retrospectively adjusted by the department. (3-19-07) 03. Cost Increases Greater Than Three Percent. When cost increases of greater than three percent (3%) of the projected interim rate which result from disasters such as fire, flood, or earthquake, epidemic or similar unusual and unpredictable circumstances over which a provider has no control. Prospective rates will be increased and they will not be subject to the cap. However, they may be retrospectively adjusted by the Department. For the purposes of this Subsection, disaster does not include personal or financial problems. (3-19-07)",

In the event of state or federal law, rule, or policy changes which result in clearly identifiable reductions in required services, the Department may reduce the prospective rate to reflect the identified per diem amount related to such reductions. (3-19-07) 05. Prospective Negotiated Rates. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 622 of these rules, the Director will have the authority to negotiate prospective rates for providers who would otherwise be subject to accept retrospective settlement. Such rates will not exceed the projected allowable rate that would otherwise be reimbursed based on provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07) 629. ICF/ID: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS. Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the following: (3-19-07) 01. In General. Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or litigation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfare, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs of which the Medicaid Program will reimburse a portion according to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. (3-19-07) 02. Administrative Appeals. In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appeal the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider’s legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that the provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07) 03. Other. All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in actions against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07) 630. ICF/ID: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. ICFs/ID will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes, property insurance, and depreciation expense or major moveable equipment will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate does not include compensation for minor movable equipment. The property rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. See Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code, for further clarification. (3-19-07) 01. Property Rental Rate. The property rental rate is based upon current construction costs, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to the following: (3-19-07) a. R = “Property Base” x 40 - “Age” / 40 x “change in building costs” where: (3-19-07) b. “R” = the property rental rate. (3-19-07) c. “Property Base” = eleven dollars and twenty-two cents ($11.22) except for ICF/ID living units not IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 630 Page 158 able to accommodate residents requiring wheelchairs beginning October 1, 1996. Property base = seven dollars and twenty-two cents ($7.22) for ICF/ID living units not able to accommodate residents requiring wheelchairs. (3-19-07) d. “Change in building costs” = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. For ICF/ID facilities, the most recent index available when it is first necessary to set a prospective rate for a period that includes all or part of the calendar year, will be used. (3-19-07) e. “Age” of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from the year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30) years, however: (3-19-07) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to document that",

No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30) years, however: (3-19-07) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to document that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set at thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building permits, tax assessors' records, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be determined for each building. A weighted average using the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large enough to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more years according to the following formula: Where: If the result of this calculation, “r” is equal to or greater than two point zero (2.0), the age of the building in years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). (3-19-07) ii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation of a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the formula in Subsection 630.01.d.i. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the point where the increase in the property rental rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate “r” for a new facility at the time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before the adjustment. The cost used for “C” will be adjusted according to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service to reflect current construction costs for average Class D convalescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation of costs. (3-19-07) iii. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requirements as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twelve (12) months of verification of expenditure, reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new requirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility. (3-19-07) iv. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility be less than the greater of the rate allowable r = A x E / S x C r = Reduction in the age of the facility in years. A = Age of the building at the time when construction was completed. E = Actual expenses for the construction provided that the total costs must have been incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of the construction. S = The number of square feet in the building at the end of construction. C = The cost of construction for the buildings in the year when construction was completed according to the schedule in Subsection 630.01.d.ii.

However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made for current or successor operators, the final settlement amount of any increase in the property rental rate will first be offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the provisions of Subsections 630.01.d.iii. and 630.01.d.iv. of these rules had not been",

This is intended to allow the postponement of the financial burden to providers of property rental rate decreases and to allow an equal offset of the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate increases for a current or successor provider. (3-19-07) v. Effective October 1, 1996, for ICF/ID facilities, “age of facility” will be a revised age which is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Section or the age which most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of September 30, 1996, under Subsection 630.01 of these rules. This revised age will not increase over time. (3-19-07) 02. Sale of a Facility. In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, the buyer will receive the property rental rate of Subsection 630.01 of these rules. (3-19-07) 631. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATIONS. Beginning October 1, 1996, property costs of an ICF/ID will be reimbursed in accordance with Section 630 of these rules except as follows: (3-19-07) 01. Restrictions. No grandfathered rates or lease provisions other than lease provisions in Section 630 of these rules will apply to ICF/ID facilities. (3-19-07) 02. Home Office and Day Treatment Property Costs. Distinct parts of buildings containing ICF/ID living units may be used for home office or day treatment purposes. Reimbursement for the property costs of such distinct parts may be allowed if these areas are used exclusively for home office or day treatment services. The portion of property cost attributed to these areas may be reimbursed as part of home office or day treatment costs without a reduction in the property rental rate. Reimbursement for home office and day treatment property costs will not include costs reimbursed by, or covered by the property rental rate. Such costs will only be reimbursed as property cost if the facility clearly included space in excess of space normally used in such facilities. At a minimum to qualify for such reimbursement, a structure would have square feet per licensed bed in excess of the average square feet per licensed bed for other ICF/ID living units within four (4) licensable beds. (3-19-07) 03. Leases for Property. Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID facilities with leases will be reimbursed as follows: (3-19-07) a. The property costs related to ICF/ID living units other than costs for major movable equipment will be paid by a property rental rate in accordance with Section 630 of these rules. (3-19-07) b. Leases for property other than ICF/ID living units will be allowable based on lease cost to the facility not to exceed a reasonable market rate, subject to other provisions of this chapter, and PRM principles including principles associated with related party leases. (3-19-07) 632. ICF/ID: SPECIAL RATES. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides that the Department may pay facilities a special rate for care given to consumers who have medical or behavior long-term care needs beyond the normal scope of facility services. These individuals must have one (1) or more of the following behavior needs; additional personnel for supervision, additional behavior management, or additional psychiatric or pharmacology services. A special rate may also be given to consumers having medical needs that may include but are not limited to individuals needing ventilator assistance, certain medical pediatric needs, or individuals requiring nasogastric or intravenous feeding devices. These medical and behavior needs are not adequately reflected in the rates calculated pursuant to the principles set in Section 56-265, Idaho Code. The payment for such specialized care will be in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provisions of this chapter and will be based on a per diem rate applicable to the incremental additional costs incurred by the facility. Payment for special rates will start with approval by the Department and be and reviewed at least yearly for continued need. The incremental cost to a facility that exceeds the rate for services provided pursuant to the provisions of Section 632 of these rules, will be excluded from the computation of payments IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 633 Page 160 or rates under other provisions of Section 56-265, Idaho Code, IDAPA 16.03.09, “Medicaid",

Costs equivalent to payments at the special rate will be removed from the cost components subject to limits, and will be reported separately. (3-19-07) 04. Limitations. The reimbursement rate paid will not exceed the provider's charges to other participants for similar services. (3-19-07) 633. REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS FOR STATE OWNED OR OPERATED ICF/ID FACILITIES. Provisions of these rules do not apply to ICF/ID facilities owned or operated by the state of Idaho. Reimbursement of such facilities will be governed by the principles set forth in the PRM, with the exception of depreciation. Assets of such facilities need not be depreciated if they have an acquisition or historical cost of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000). (3-19-07) 634. -- 648. (RESERVED) 649. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY. The Department will pay for developmental therapy provided by facilities that have entered into a provider agreement with the Department and are certified as developmental disabilities agencies by the Department. (7-1-13) 650. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY: ELIGIBILITY. Prior to receiving developmental therapy in a DDA an individual must be determined by the Department or its contractor to have a developmental disability under Sections 500 through 506 of these rules and Section 66-402, Idaho Code be eighteen (18) years of age or older, and live in the community. (7-1-13) 651. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY: COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS. Developmental therapy must be recommended by a physician or other practitioner of the healing arts. (7-1-13) 01. Requirements to Deliver Developmental Therapy. Developmental therapy may be delivered in a developmental disabilities agency center-based program, the community, or the home of the participant. Participants living in a certified family home must not receive home-based developmental therapy in a certified family home. Developmental therapy includes individual developmental therapy and group developmental therapy. Developmental therapy must be delivered by Developmental Specialists or paraprofessionals qualified in accordance with these rules, based on an assessment completed prior to the delivery of developmental therapy.

In addition to the children’s home and community based state plan option services described in Section 663 of these rules, the following services are available for waiver eligible participants and are reimbursable services when provided in accordance with these rules: (7-1-11) 01. Family Training. Family training is professional one-on-one (1 on 1) instruction to families to help them better meet the needs of the waiver participant receiving intervention services. (7-1-11) a. Family training is limited to training in the implementation of intervention techniques as outlined in the plan of service. (7-1-11) b.

For participants enrolled in the Children’s DD Waiver, the amount, duration, and frequency of the training must be determined by the family-centered planning team and the parent or legal guardian, and must be listed as a service on the plan of service. (7-1-11) ii. For participants enrolled in the Act Early Waiver, the parent or legal guardian will be required to be present and actively participate during the intervention service session for at least twenty percent (20%) of the intervention time provided to the child. (7-1-11) 02. Interdisciplinary Training. Interdisciplinary training is professional instruction to the direct service provider.

The purpose of the habilitative intervention evaluation is to guide the formation of developmentally-appropriate objectives and intervention strategies related to goals identified through the family-centered planning process. The habilitative interventionist must complete an evaluation prior to the initial provision of habilitative intervention services. The evaluation must include: (7-1-11) a. Specific skills assessments for deficit areas identified through the eligibility assessment; (7-1-11) b. Functional behavioral analysis; (7-1-11) c. Review of all assessments and relevant histories provided by the plan developer; and (7-1-11) d. Clinical Opinion. Professional summary that interprets and integrates the results of the testing. This summary includes functional, developmentally appropriate recommendations to guide treatment. (7-1-11) 04. Habilitative Intervention. Habilitative intervention services must be consistent, aggressive, and continuous and are provided to improve a child’s functional skills and minimize problem behavior. Services include individual or group behavioral interventions and skill development activity. Habilitative intervention must be based upon the well-known and widely regarded principles of evidence-based treatment. Evidence-based treatment (EBT) refers to the use of mental and behavioral health interventions for which systematic empirical research has provided evidence of statistically significant effectiveness as treatments for specific problems. As “promising practices” meet statistically significant effectiveness, they could be included as approved approaches. (7-1-11) a. Habilitative intervention must be provided to meet the intervention needs of the participant by developing adaptive skills for all participants, and addressing maladaptive behaviors for participants who exhibit them.

(7-1-11) i. When goals to address maladaptive behavior are identified on the plan of service, the intervention must include the development of replacement behavior rather than merely the elimination or suppression of maladaptive behavior that interferes with the child’s overall general development, community, and social participation. (7-1-11) ii. When goals to address skill development are identified on the plan of service, the intervention must provide for the acquisition of skills that are functional. (7-1-11) b. Habilitative intervention must be provided in the participant’s home or community setting, and in addition may be provided in a center-based setting. (7-1-11) c. Group intervention may be provided in the community and center. When habilitative intervention is provided as group intervention, the following applies: (7-1-11) i. There must be a minimum of one (1) qualified staff providing direct services for every three (3) participants. As the number and severity of the participants with functional impairments or behavioral issues IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 683 Page 179 increases, the staff participant ratio must be adjusted accordingly. (7-1-11) ii. When group intervention is community-based, the child must be integrated in the community in a natural setting with typically developing peers. (7-1-11) iii. Group intervention must be directly related to meeting the needs of the child, and be identified as an objective in accordance with a plan of service goal. (7-1-11) 05. Therapeutic Consultation. Therapeutic consultation provides a higher level of expertise and experience to support participants who exhibit severe aggression, self-injury, and other dangerous behaviors. Therapeutic consultation is provided when a participant receiving habilitative intervention has been assessed as requiring a more advanced level of training and assistance based on the participant’s complex needs. A participant requires therapeutic consultation when interventions are not demonstrating outcomes and it is anticipated that a crisis event may occur without the consultation service. (7-1-11) a. The therapeutic consultant assists the habilitative interventionist by: (7-1-11) i. Performing advanced assessments as necessary; (7-1-11) ii. Developing and overseeing the implementation of a positive behavior support plan; (7-1-11) iii. Monitoring the progress and coordinating the implementation of the positive behavioral support plan across environments; and (7-1-11) iv.

Crisis Intervention. Crisis intervention services provide direct consultation and clinical evaluation of participants who are currently experiencing or may be expected to experience a psychological, behavioral, or emotional crisis. The need for crisis intervention must meet the definition of crisis in Section 681 of these rules. This service may provide training and staff development related to the needs of a participant, and also provides emergency back-up involving the direct support of the participant in crisis. Children’s crisis intervention services: (7-1-11) a. Are provided in the home and community. (7-1-11) b. Are provided on a short-term basis typically not to exceed thirty (30) days. (7-1-11) c.

Families of participants eligible for the children’s DD waiver may choose to direct their individualized budget rather than receive the traditional services described in Subsections 683.01 through 683.06 of this rule when the participant lives at home with the parent or legal guardian. The requirements for selecting and participating in this option are outlined in IDAPA 16.03.13 “Consumer Directed Services.” Act Early Waiver participants do not have the option to choose the family-directed services path. The Act Early Waiver is intended to be a more structured program that requires increased involvement from families, and ensures children receive an intense amount of services based on evidence-based research. (7-1-11) 08. Service limitations. Children’s waiver services are subject to the following limitations: (7-1-11) a. Place of Service Delivery. Waiver services may be provided in the participant's personal residence, community, or DDA.

    "text": "Understanding the Idaho Skilled Nursing Facility Medicaid rate sheet There are several data items present on the rate summary sheet sent each quarter to Idaho skilled nursing providers. Understanding each of these data items and their interrelationship with various facility operations is critical to adjusting practices to maximize reimbursement. The purpose of this paper is to explain each section of the rate summary page and identify certain items operators should be watching to ensure they are receiving appropriate reimbursement. For the purposes of this explanation, the rate sheet will be divided into six sections. These sections are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. The case mix tables, located in the upper ¼ of the summary page, The cost detail, located between the CMI table and Rate Calculations, The indirect cost column, located slightly below and left of the center of the page, The direct cost column, located slightly below and to the right of the center of the page, The exempt cost column, located to the right of the direct cost column, and The Summary of Rate Components, located in the lower right corner of the page. Please refer to the Rate Calculation Worksheet included at the end of this explanation. The six sections are described in detail below. SECTION 1: THE CASE MIX INDEX TABLE The case mix table on the Rate Calculation Worksheet looks like this: CMI Table Rate Period C/R Period Facility Wide: 1.1065 1.1582 Facility Medicaid: 1.1110 1.0872 State-Wide Avg.: 1.1638 1.1467 The Case Mix Index (CMI) is calculated based on the MDS’s that are regularly sent by facilities to the state repository. Idaho uses a 34-group RUG III model, nursing weights only. The weights by RUG category are listed on the last page. The state has a computer program which automatically converts the MDS 3.0 to the RUG III grouper system. Every quarter, each facility receives a report from Myers and Stauffer that lists all patients with MDS’s in the state repository, along with each patient’s payor status, RUG category, and case mix score. It is imperative that the facility review this information and Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 1 of 9 send corrections to the state as soon as possible. You cannot change the RUG category on this page, but you can change whether a certain patient was in the facility as of the picture date (the last day of the previous quarter) and their payor status. If a patient’s payor status changed from Medicare to Medicaid between the time the MDS was submitted and the end of the picture date (remember you do not need to complete an MDS when taking a patient off Medicare), note on the page the new payor source and the effective date. If a patient is listed on the page and he or she was discharged or expired between the time the MDS was submitted and the picture date and the discharge tracking form has not been submitted to the state repository yet, state that the patient was discharged and list the date of discharge on the patient list. You cannot add patients to the list who were admitted before the picture date but whose MDS’s were not submitted in time to appear on the patient list from Myers and Stauffer. For this reason, you should submit MDS’s frequently, and especially just prior to the picture date, to get the most accurate picture of your current patient population. Although it is required for MDS’s to be submitted within 30 days after closing and locking, most facilities submit MDS’s on a weekly basis. Not only does this ensure the most up to date information is in the state repository, it reduces potential problems of computer malfunctions or other issues preventing MDS transmission within the allowable time frames. Further, after you submit MDS’s to the state, you receive a Validation Report. The MDS submitter should review this document to be sure all MDS’s were received and processed correctly and that none were rejected. It is much better to do this with smaller reports on a weekly basis rather than a very large report if you submit only once per month. The CMI for the Cost Report (C/R) period is an aggregation of the MDS’s submitted to the state repository during your particular facility’s cost report period. The table includes the average CMI for all patients in your facility during the cost report period, all Medicaid patients in your facility during the cost report period, and the state-wide average case mix score for all patients in Idaho skilled nursing facilities during your facility’s cost report period. The CMI for the Rate Period lists the average case mix index for your facility for the quarter used to determine your rate. Average CMI scores are",

The table includes the average CMI for all patients in your facility during the cost report period, all Medicaid patients in your facility during the cost report period, and the state-wide average case mix score for all patients in Idaho skilled nursing facilities during your facility’s cost report period. The CMI for the Rate Period lists the average case mix index for your facility for the quarter used to determine your rate. Average CMI scores are listed for all patients in your facility for the Rate Period, plus your facility’s Medicaid patients only, plus the state wide average CMI for the rate period. The “Rate Period” is always a three month lag, so the MDS’s submitted to the state from January 1 through March 31 impacts your reimbursement rates effective July 1 of that year. MDS’s submitted from April 1 through June 30 impact your rates effective October 1, and so on. Out of the six CMI figures listed on the table, only three are used for the current rate calculation quarter: the Facility Wide CMI for the Cost Report Period; the State-Wide Average for the Cost Report Period, and the Facility Medicaid for the Rate Period. The usage of these CMI’s is described below under Section 4: Direct Cost Component. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 2 of 9 Analyzing/Interpretation/Improving the CMI Data First, look at your baseline. This is your facility CMI scores for the entire facility for the cost report period. Compare this average to the state average. Three situations are possible: Your average Facility-Wide CMI is higher than the state average. This normally means you have a higher Medicare population, and/or you are taking care of an overall higher acuity population than most Idaho skilled nursing facilities. Your facility staff probably does a good job of documenting mood and behaviors, ADLs, restorative care, and other factors that place more patients in higher acuity RUG categories. This also means your facility will have a higher direct care cap, because your facility-specific direct care cap is calculated by dividing the facility-wide case mix index for the cost report period by the state-wide average CMI for the cost report period and multiplying the result by the Per Diem Limit for direct care (explained in more detail under Section 4 below). Your average Facility-Wide CMI is lower than the state average. You may just be treating lighter care patients overall, but it could also be that your staff aren’t documenting items that positively impact your case mix index. See below for suggestions on improving your case mix index. Your average Facility-Wide CMI is almost the same as the state average. Your facility is neither better nor worse than other Idaho skilled facilities in terms of acuity scores, and you are very close to the average for Medicare census and acuity. What to do now? Suppose you want to review your acuity scores to make sure they are accurate, and that your Medicaid rates are based on your current acuity. First, compare the CMI for the rate period with the CMI for the cost report period for all three indicators. For example, if your facility wide CMI scores for the most recent rate period are higher than the cost report period, you are either taking credit for accurate assessments of ADL assistance provided and other factors positively impacting your CMI, or you are simply taking care of an overall higher acuity patient population. On the example CMI table on Page 1, you’ll see that the facility-wide CMI for the rate period is lower than the cost report period. While the facility-wide CMI for the rate period is not used for any part of the rate setting process, it does give you an indication of a trend in your overall acuity. If you feel the need to review the MDS’s of patients to make sure those factors impacting the acuity score are accurate, your time would be best spent following these guidelines: 1. Identify all Medicaid patients with acuity scores at or below your facility average CMI. Especially focus on the PA1 patients with an acuity score of 0.49.

Find out from the therapists who came off therapy over the past three months and see if they were transitioned into a restorative program.

Find out from the therapists who came off therapy over the past three months and see if they were transitioned into a restorative program. List all patients who are currently on a structured restorative program. Review your Quality Indicators and note all patients who triggered for a decline in ADL’s or range of motion. Begin your chart audit of each patient identified above. Questions to answer include: a. b. c. d. e. How frequently is restorative care provided? It must be provided 6 days per week, two activities per day for 15 minutes per activity. If you are only providing restorative nursing care five days per week, it does not count as a restorative program for MDS purposes. Are restorative minutes documented accurately? Again, it needs to be 15 minutes per day per activity. Further, the restorative program must be overseen by a licensed nurse, and the restorative nursing assistants must have appropriate training. Is the ADL portion of the care plan appropriate, and does it list interventions that should be done but aren’t being done? Are there interventions that should be listed that aren’t included in the care plan? Are the goals measurable, and are they reviewed periodically? Are side rails listed as a mobility device instead of a restraint? If so, is restorative care being provided to make sure the patient is actually using the side rail as a bed mobility device or is the side rail actually a restraint? If the MDS is coded as a 3, 4, or 8 under Bed Mobility, there is a question of whether side rails are appropriately listed as bed mobility devices, and they will probably be deemed restraints by surveyors. Is the ADL coding accurate? Does it match the aide flow sheets? You should also talk directly with the caregivers on all shifts to be sure the coding is accurate. Remember that column B on Section G1 of the MDS says to code for “Most support provided over all shifts during last 7 days” and that the most support needed by the patient is probably not at 10 am when the restorative aides or therapists are right there, but at 7 am on Sunday morning when the aides provide a 2+ physical assist for bed mobility or transfer. Look especially closely at copy cat charting, where the aides simply put the previous day’s or shift’s code in the current shift’s flow sheet. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 4 of 9 f. Have any behaviors occurred over the past several weeks, and have they been appropriately documented in the nurse’s notes and behavior sheets, and were those observations transferred over to the MDS? g. Is there anything out of the ordinary in the nurse’s notes, social services notes, therapy notes, or the physician progress notes? For example, there may be something noted in one disciplines’ notes that wasn’t corroborated in other notes which would impact the acuity score. h. Can the patient benefit from a Part B therapy program? If that therapy is provided during the assessment window, regardless of how it was paid, it counts as therapy on the MDS and results in a higher RUG score. i. Are there skin issues that weren’t accurately coded on the MDS? Some people do not like to code stage 1 pressure ulcers because they think it results in a survey flag. While this is partially correct, if you are treating a skin issue as a pressure ulcer, it needs to be listed as a pressure ulcer on the MDS. Two or more sites at any stage, or one at stage 3 or 4 result in a RUG category of SS. 6. Personally examine the patient. See for yourself how much independence he or she has, and how much assistance is provided, in transferring, bed mobility, eating, and toilet use. Using all of the above information, determine if the MDS accurately depicts the patient’s condition. You should also determine if that patient is a candidate for Part B therapy or for initiation, modification, or termination of a restorative program. If you find the MDS is incorrect, follow the correction policy guidelines set by CMS. But also remember that several significant changes to your facility’s MDS’s may trigger increased scrutiny from surveyors, who may question why there was a breakdown in facility systems and processes that would allow inaccurate assessments to be filed with the state. Finally, some providers may wish to increase their CMI by providing more therapy services that they usually provide during an assessment window.",

Finally, some providers may wish to increase their CMI by providing more therapy services that they usually provide during an assessment window. While this practice will increase the CMI for that rate period, these higher case mix numbers will be averaged into the overall facility CMI when the cost report is filed. Future quarterly CMI adjustments will then be divided by the artificially higher base CMI and potentially reduce rates in future periods. This “double edged sword” reveals a simultaneous benefit and limitation of the SNF reimbursement system: facilities with gradual changes in CMI, census, and costs under the cap can do very well under this payment methodology. Facilities with large variations in CMI, census, and costs will have quarters and years that Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 5 of 9 are extremely profitable, and other quarters and years in which they will experience financial hardship. SECTION 2: COST DETAIL AND INFLATION ADJUSTMENT In the upper one third of the Rate Calculation Worksheet is a section labeled “Inflated Cost Summary.” The column under “Cost Detail” contains figures derived from your cost report. If your rate is a finalized rate based on an audited cost report, these totals can be traced directly from the “Schedule of Adjusted Costs” pages of your audit report. If your rate is an interim rate based on reported costs, in order to trace these amounts, you will need to request information from Myers and Stauffer. Myers and Stauffer uses your as-filed cost report and separates cost centers between the direct, indirect, property, and exempt cost centers. The cost report information included here is from the cost report period listed in the upper part of the Rate Calculation Worksheet. The derivation of the costs on the summary page is detailed in the subsequent pages of the rate sheet calculations. You, or your cost accountant, should be able to track costs listed on the cost report to the rate sheet. The Inflation Adjustment is no longer used, as it was removed in 2011 Legislature. Rates are now based strictly on historical costs per patient day. The third column in this section is entitled, “CMI Adjust for Food and Ancillaries or Indirect Ancillary Gross-Up.” This column performs two functions. First, food and the direct portion of ancillaries are included in direct care rate calculation, but are not case mix adjusted. Because all costs in the “Direct Cost” column of page one of the rate calculation worksheet are case mix adjusted, that case mix adjustment is reversed here to have a net impact of zero. Therefore, the costs associated with food and direct ancillary expenses are “reverse case mix adjusted” for lack of a better term, so that the entire direct care cost total can be case mix adjusted. Second, this column is also used to gross up ancillary costs. Ancillary costs included in the first column are the costs attributed solely to Medicaid services. Therefore, the Medicaid portion of ancillaries are grossed up by taking Medicaid ancillary cost, dividing by Medicaid days, times total patient days. This is necessary because on page 1 of the Rate Calculation Worksheet, total costs are divided by total days to calculate a per diem. Therefore, ancillary costs associated with just the Medicaid portion should be grossed up to reflect the total cost. The final column in this section is the sum of the previous three columns, and the totals by line item are then carried below to the columns in the lower one half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet page. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 6 of 9 SECTION 3: INDIRECT COST COMPONENT The lower half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the final rate calculation. The first column of numbers in this section presents the Indirect Cost component of your rate. Indirect costs include primarily overhead cost areas such as administration, housekeeping, dietary costs (except raw food), activities, and so on. The Indirect Cost Component is calculated according to the process outlined below: 1. The total indirect costs are divided by the total patient days in the cost report period to arrive at the indirect cost per patient day. 2. The cap for the current rate period is listed. It is the amount equal to 117% of the",

It is the amount equal to 117% of the median rate for indirect costs for all Idaho SNFs and is recalculated annually. 3. The facility indirect rate is the lesser of the inflated costs or the cap, so if the facility is below the indirect cap, it only the per diem costs per patient day. If it is over the cap, it will only receive the cap as its indirect cost component of its final rate. SECTION 4: DIRECT COST COMPONENT The second column of numbers in the lower half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the derivation of your facility’s Direct Cost Component of your Medicaid rate. Direct costs include nursing and social service salaries and benefits, nursing supplies, Medicaid-related ancillaries, and raw food. The Direct Cost Component is calculated as follows: 1. 2. The total direct costs from the upper section of the Rate Calculation Worksheet are listed on the first line this column, and this total is divided by the total patient days for the cost report period to arrive at the direct cost per patient day. The state cap on Direct Costs is shown as the Per Diem Limit. This cap is an overall state cap, and the cap is adjusted for each facility based on that facility’s overall acuity for the cost report period compared to the state average acuity. The facility-specific cap is calculated by dividing the facility- wide average CMI for the cost report period by the state average CMI for the cost report period and multiplying the result by the state cap. Using the CMI table on page 1, the facility-wide CMI for the cost report period is 1.1582, and the state average CMI for the same period was 1.1467. The formula and resulting facility-specific cap is shown below:Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 7 of 9 3. Facility-wide CMI = 1.1582 = 1.0100 State Avg CMI 1.1467 Therefore, because the facility has an overall acuity slightly higher than the state average (exactly 1 percent higher than the state average), it makes sense that it would have a higher cap. The lower of the inflated cost per patient day (described in #1 of this section) or the facility-specific cap on direct costs is then adjusted to reflect the assumed ratio of costs associated with Medicaid patients compared to all other patients (private, Medicare, VA, insurance, etc.) in the facility. This adjustment divides the Facility Medicaid CMI for the Rate Period by the Facility Wide CMI for the cost report period. Using the case mix table on page 1, the resulting calculation is: Medicaid avg CMI = 1.1110 = 0.9592 Facility-wide CMI 1.1582 The direct cost component, and the customary charge calculation (below) are the only parts of the Medicaid rate that changes throughout the year. The change to the direct portion of the rate is based solely on acuity scores for Medicaid patients for the period ending 90 days prior to the current rate period (MDS’s submitted between January 1 and March 31 will impact direct care rates effective July 1-September 30). SECTION 5: EXEMPT COSTS AND NATCEP Exempt costs include property taxes, property insurance, utilities, and costs associated with the Nurse Aide Training and Certification Evaluation Program (NATCEP). For hospital-based providers, exempt costs also include property costs. These are pass- through costs not subject to any limitation. SECTION 6: SUMMARY OF RATE COMPONENTS The lower right corner of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the summary of all of the individual components of your facility’s Medicaid rate. It also includes the property component, which is defined in detail in Idaho rule. In general, the property rate for free- standing nursing facilities is based on the Marshall-Swift Valuation Index, and the age of all nursing facilities in Idaho have been frozen at their age in 1991 for facilities constructed on or before that date. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 8 of 9 Look at your own Medicaid rate sheet to see how these components add up.

Remember there is also an additional 2.7 percent reduction because Idaho’s budget shortfalls during 2009-2011. This amount was replaced with a provider tax so the facilities will get this amount returned to them through a different program. Finally, your Medicaid rate is limited to the lesser of the sum of rate components or the customary charge. The customary charge is calculated as your semi-private room rate plus the Medicaid charges of reimbursable ancillaries. The ancillary portion is inflated to the rate period using the same method for inflating costs, and is also case mix adjusted by dividing facility Medicaid CMI for the rate period by facility Medicaid CMI for the cost report period. The result of the Medicaid ancillary portion is divided by Medicaid days and is added to your semi-private room rate. For this reason, it is imperative that you charge out all appropriate ancillary services and supplies to all patients, including those whose primary payor is the Medicaid program.

General Billing Instructions, Provider Handbook Modifications .............. 150 July 1, 2025 Page iv Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions General Billing Instructions The General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, is applicable to all provider types, and must be followed except where otherwise stated for a specific provider type. Should the handbook ever appear to contradict relevant provisions of Idaho or federal regulations, the regulations prevail. Any paper or digital copy of these documents is considered out of date except the version appearing on Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website. This handbook covers basic billing information providers need to submit claims and adjustments to Idaho Medicaid for services processed by Gainwell Technologies (GWT). It describes Medicaid billing policies; how to submit claims electronically, on paper, or directly into Health PAS; how to check claim status or where to get help with claim submital. In addition, it describes the prior authorization (PA) process, third party liability (TPL), and claim review requests/pre-appeals/adjustments (both online and paper). Providers must follow their provider type or service specific handbook as located in the Provider Guidelines. Handbook sections in addition to this one that always apply to providers include: • General Information and Requirements for Providers; and • Glossary. Handbooks can only be used properly in context. Providers must be familiar with the handbooks that affect them and their services. The numbering in handbooks is also important to make note of as subsections rely on the content of the sections above them. Example Section 1.2.3.a The Answer requires the reader to have also read Section 1, Section 1.2 and Section 1.2.3 to be able to properly apply Section 1.2.3.a. References are included throughout the handbook for provider and staff convenience. Not all applicable references have been incorporated into the handbook. Not all references provided are equal in weight. • Case Law: Includes references to court cases that established interpretations of law that states and providers would be required to follow. • CMS Guidance: These references reflect various Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. The publications are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid services. • Federal Regulations: These references are regulations from the federal level that affected policy development. Usually these include the Code of Federal Regulations, the Social Security Act and other statutes. Federal regulations must be followed. • Idaho Medicaid Publications: These are communications from Idaho Medicaid to providers that were required to be followed when published. These are included in the handbook for historical reference. The provider handbook supersedes other communications unless the documents are listed in the Policies, Procedures, and Waivers webpage under policies in Medicaid Policies library. • Idaho",

Medicaid Billing Policies Once enrolled, providers may bill for services rendered to Idaho Medicaid participants. Providers are not obligated to accept all Medicaid participants on an ongoing, day-to-day basis. Provider enrollment signifies only that a provider will bill Medicaid if they accept a Medicaid participant as a patient. Providers shall charge their usual and customary fee for services and submit those charges to Medicaid for payment consideration unless otherwise instructed. Providers must accept payment from Medicaid as payment in full for covered services. See the Participant Financial Responsibility section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for circumstances when a participant may be billed. If the participant has other insurance, the provider must bill the other insurance and complete all billing requirements for that carrier first, and then bill Medicaid. See the Third-Party Liability section for additional information. Idaho Medicaid does not support billing and payment by cost centers. Hospitals should bill applicable revenue codes listed in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. Revenue codes not listed are not covered. To be eligible for reimbursement, providers must abide by Department communications such as Information Releases, MedicAide newsletters, the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, and state and federal regulations. Coverage policies in place at the time of service should be followed. Policies on how to bill may change and be retroactive to the date of service to accommodate the claim system. This is to ensure successful payment of claims without significant delay. Information provided by Gainwell Technologies (GWT), Idaho Medicaid’s contractor, cannot supersede these requirements or substitute the provider’s responsibility to understand and follow them. 1.1 References: Medicaid Billing Policies 1.1.1 Federal Regulations Acceptance of State Payment as Payment in Full, 42 CFR 447.15 (2013).

Providers risk claim denials due to duplicate logic, overlapping dates, and/or mutually exclusive edits. When date spanning, services must have been provided for every day within that span. For example, it would be incorrect to date span the entire week or month when services were only performed on Thursday and Saturday within the same week or January 1 and January 10 within the same month.

Outpatient claims that overlap inpatient claims will be denied unless otherwise stated in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. 1.2.1 References: Billing Procedure for Date Spanning (a) Idaho Medicaid Publications “Date Spanning.” MedicAide Newsletter, August 2005. “Date Spanning Clarification.” MedicAide Newsletter, June 2008. “Date Spanning Clarification.” MedicAide Newsletter, October 2005. July 1, 2025 Page 5 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.3 Billing 15-Minute Timed Codes Several CPT® and HCPC codes used for evaluations, therapy modalities, procedures, and collateral contacts specify that one (1) unit equals 15 minutes. Providers must bill procedure codes for the services they delivered using CPT® codes and the appropriate number of units of service. The beginning and ending time of the treatment must be recorded in the participant’s medical record with a note describing the treatment. Only time spent directly working with the participant is counted. For any single CPT® code, providers may bill a single 15-minute unit for treatment that is greater than or equal to eight (8) minutes and less than 23 minutes in a day. Time intervals for treatments lasting 23-minutes or longer on a single date of service are as follows: Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes Number of Units Time Interval 2 units ≥ 23 minutes to < 38 minutes 3 units ≥ 38 minutes to < 53 minutes 4 units ≥ 53 minutes to < 68 minutes 5 units ≥ 68 minutes to < 83 minutes 6 units ≥ 83 minutes to < 98 minutes 7 units ≥ 98 minutes to < 113 minutes 8 units ≥ 113 minutes to < 128 minutes The pattern remains the same for treatment times over two hours. Providers should not bill for services performed for less than eight (8) minutes. The expectation (based on work values for these codes) is that a provider’s time for each unit will average 15 minutes in length. If a provider has a practice of billing less than 15 minutes for a unit, these situations should be highlighted for review. When more than one service represented by codes and measured in 15-minute increments is performed on a single date of service, the total number of minutes for all services should be added together to determine the number of units that can be billed for that date of service. Multiple timed services should not be combined into a single billing code. See the “Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes” table above to determine how many units are billable. The total number of units billable should be distributed based on the time spent per code to best fit the allowed units. See the examples below for appropriate time coding. Billing Multiple 15 Minute Timed Codes Time Spent Billed Units Explanation Example 1 Code 1 36 minutes Code 2 35 minutes 2 Total 71 minutes 5 3 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes” 71 minutes equals 5 units. Each of the codes was billed for 30 minutes so should be billed at least a minimum of 2 units each. Since Code 1 took more time than Code 2 the remaining unit should be assigned there even though by itself Code 1 wouldn’t qualify for 3 units. Example 2 Code 1 20 minutes Code 2 20 minutes 1 Total 40 minutes 3 2 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes” 40 minutes equals 3 units. Each of the codes was billed for at least 15 minutes so should be billed at least 1 units each. Since both services took the same amount July 1, 2025 Page 6 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions of time, the provider can assign the remaining unit to either code they decide. Example 3 Code 1 33 minutes Code 2 7 minutes 1 Total 40 minutes 3 2 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed",

Example 3 Code 1 33 minutes Code 2 7 minutes 1 Total 40 minutes 3 2 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes” 40 minutes equals 3 units. Code 1 was provided for 2 full units. Since Code 2 did not meet the 8-minute threshold for 1 unit, compare the unassigned time from Code 1 (3 minutes) with Code 2 (7 minutes). Bill the remaining unit with the code that has the largest unassigned time i.e., Code 2. Example 4 Code 1 16 minutes Code 2 10 minutes 1 Code 3 10 minutes 1 Code 4 8 minutes 0 Total 44 minutes 3 1 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes” 49 minutes equals 3 units. All codes performed would qualify for a single unit on the chart above, but since they were performed on the same day the time is added up to determine the number of billable units. Since all the codes qualify for 1 unit, the units are divided equally among the top codes. Although Code 4 isn’t being reimbursed directly, it must still be documented since its time is being reimbursed in the other codes. Example 5 Code 1 7 minutes Code 2 7 minutes 0 Code 3 7 minutes 0 Total 21 minutes 1 1 According to this section 21 minutes is eligible for 1 unit. As all the codes were performed for the same amount of time, the performing professional selects once to bill with the 1 unit. Although Codes 2 and 3 aren’t being reimbursed directly, they must be documented since their time is being used to justify the reimbursement for Code 1. 1.3.1 References: Billing 15-Minute Timed Codes (a) CMS Guidance “Chapter 5 – Part B Outpatient Rehabilitation and CORF/OPT Services.” Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c05.pdf. “Chapter 15 – Covered Medical and Other Health Services.” Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c15.pdf.

The state’s EVV Aggregator and related certification and training materials are provided by Sandata (www.sandata.com). PAA EVV data is reviewed quarterly by the Bureau of Long-Term Care (BLTC). The required compliance threshold is automatically verified visit data for 85% or more of visits that occur in the reporting period. Any provider that has 15% or more of its EVV visits manually verified in any quarter will be required to improve. The EVV Provider Help Aid is available to assist providers. As part of its EVV data monitoring process, the BLTC will identify providers that were deficient in the reporting quarter. • If the provider is deficient for the second consecutive calendar quarter, the provider will receive a request for an EVV Action Plan. The provider must return the completed action plan via email to BLTCQA@dhw.idaho.gov. The provider will receive an approval or denial of their plan from a BLTC Quality Assurance Specialist. • If the provider was not deficient during the previous quarter, an email notification will be sent with an EVV Response Form. The agency must return the completed form via email to BLTCQA@dhw.idaho.gov.

When a participant is on hospice care, the hospice agency is responsible for all services related to the hospice diagnosis. If a provider bills for services not related to the participant's hospice diagnosis to expedite payment, the provider may submit a claim via direct data entry (DDE) using the provider’s Trading Partner Account (TPA) and attach supporting documentation that the services are not related to the hospice diagnosis. Supporting documentation can include a visit summary or an explanatory letter. Any issues or questions concerning services for hospice participants should be referred to the hospice provider.

July 1, 2025 Page 13 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.7 340B Pharmacy Billing Congress created the Medicaid rebate program to lower the cost of pharmaceuticals reimbursed by state Medicaid agencies. Congress extended to safety-net providers the same kind of relief from high drug costs that Congress provided to the Medicaid program with the Medicaid rebate law with the 340B requirements. This may apply to the outpatient pharmacy program, hospitals, and to physician-administered drugs. Providers who obtain status as a 340B pharmacy and receive reduced costs from the manufacturer must determine if they will provide drugs from their 340B stock to Idaho Medicaid participants. According to regulations, 340B providers may bill in one of two ways: • • “carve Medicaid in” “carve Medicaid out” Providers choosing to “carve Medicaid in” have to enroll with Idaho Medicaid as a 340B entity and provide a copy of their completed Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 304B registration. Under this option, providers must use their 340B stock for Medicaid participants. This applies to the provider’s inpatient services, outpatient clinics and retail pharmacies. Contract pharmacies, however, are not eligible under the 340B program unless they separately enroll. Carved-in 340B providers must only bill for drugs from their 340B stock for those drugs received under that program. Providers must bill no more than the acquisition price on 340B claims and append the UD modifier for primary Medicaid or commercial plan claims. Providers billing Medicare as primary must use the JG or TB modifier, as applicable. Reimbursement will be limited to the provider’s actual acquisition cost not to exceed the 340B ceiling price with a professional dispensing fee. Providers that choose the option to “carve Medicaid out” must use drugs purchased through regular rates and prices. The provider is required to bill their usual and customary price for these drugs on their claims and will be paid at the usual rate. A carved-in provider that elects to withdraw from the program must provide thirty (30) days’ notice. 1.7.1 References: 340B Pharmacy Billing (a) Idaho Medicaid Publications “Billing 340B Pharmacy Claims.” MedicAide Newsletter, December 2023, https://www.idmedicaid.com/MedicAide%20Newsletters/December%202023%20MedicAide. pdf.

July 1, 2025 Page 17 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.9 Prior Authorization A prior authorization (PA) is a written, faxed or electronic approval from the Department that permits payment or coverage of an item or service that is only covered by such an authorization. This section only covers PAs for services billed through Gainwell Technologies (GWT). Some items and services always require a PA, such as: • Items and services identified on the Numerical Fee Schedule; • Services listed in the Appendix of the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for ICD-10-PCS codes that always require a PA. • Service Coordination services for children with special health needs; • Community-based Crisis Services; • Home and community-based services (HCBS) for the following waivers: o Adult Developmental Disabilities (DD) Waiver; and o Aged and Disabled (A&D) Waiver; • Personal care services, including family personal care services (FPCS); • Preventative Health Assistance (PHA) services; • Cosmetic and reconstructive surgery; • Services/procedures for participants under the age of 21, identified as medically necessary as part of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT); • Surgery related to obesity; • Transition Management for referral and relocation assistance after extended hospitalization; • Transplants; • Transportation by an ambulance or individual/commercial transportation provider for non-emergency Medicaid covered services from an Idaho Medicaid medical provider; and • Any urgent/emergency inpatient or outpatient treatment where the procedure or diagnosis code appears on the select pre-authorization list must be reviewed by Telligen within one working day of admission. The surgical procedures on the select pre-authorization list must be authorized regardless of the place of service. The diagnoses on the select pre-authorization list are for inpatient only. Other services may only require a PA under these circumstances: • The participant has exhausted their benefit; • The participant does not meet the established criteria, but can demonstrate a medical need; or • The participant has an additional benefit such as EPSDT services or a waiver that can only be accessed through a prior authorization. Items and services that require a PA must receive approval before they can be delivered to the participant except as otherwise noted. It is the provider’s responsibility to verify the participant’s eligibility on the date of service and to request any required PA. PA requirements specific to a service or item are listed throughout the handbook for the provider’s convenience. For information regarding whether a prior authorization is required, providers can use the below resources for services billed to GWT: • Check participant eligibility and PA requirements through their Trading Partner Account at www.idmedicaid.com; • Check the Idaho Medicaid Numerical Fee Schedule available online for CPT® and HCPCS that always require a PA; and • See the Appendix in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for ICD-10-PCS codes that always require a PA. July 1, 2025 Page 18 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions PA requests are rejected when there is no clear indication that a prior authorization is required. Providers should note the reason for the request in the notes section of the portal or form when the item or service does not always require a prior authorization. Urgent requests may be submitted by writing “urgent” on the request form. Urgent requests should only be submitted when the participant needs equipment, services, or supplies to discharge from a facility or to prevent immediate admission to one. Urgent requests for discharge, must include the expected date of discharge on the request form. Requests for a PA or an approved authorization for services does not guarantee payment. All other Department requirements must be met. Authorizations only confirm medical necessity criteria has been met for the item or service based on the documentation submitted.

The Department’s, or its designee’s, review of prior authorizations includes general criteria requirements in addition to any item specific criteria. Reviews do not determine if a provider or place of service is appropriate or any other considerations. Reimbursement is dependent on the participant’s eligibility on the date authorized services are rendered. The claim for reimbursement must meet all applicable requirements such as: • Policy requirements; • Be appropriate and effective treatment for the participant’s current medical condition; • Be furnished by providers with the appropriate credentials; • Be the most cost-effective method of meeting the participant’s medical needs; and • Meet all federal and state regulations. Medicaid issues written notifications of authorization or denials for all written requests for PA. Participants receive a Notice of Decision by mail with information on appeal rights and how to request a hearing if they disagree with the Department’s decision. Providers receive notifications based on their profile’s preferences. If the participant or provider disagrees with the Department’s decision they can request a reconsideration or file an appeal. Approved authorizations are valid only for the period between the start and stop dates. If the service is to be delivered outside of the approved dates, a new PA request must be submitted. Requests should be made before the expiration of the previous authorization to avoid breaks in care. Providers billing for authorized services or items must include PA numbers on the appropriate claim line or they will deny. Claims for inpatient services must have prior authorization numbers on the header or each claim line, or the claim will deny. Some authorizations may also include modifiers as part of the approval. Authorizations that include a modifier must include it on the claim line, or it will deny. The PA number and any required modifier are found on the paper Notice of Decision (NOD) letter or online through the Trading Partner Account (TPA) under View Authorizations. Medical items or services subject to a PA by Idaho Medicaid’s designated authorizing entity, will deny for payment, if provided prior to obtaining authorization unless otherwise specified. Exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis, if the provider demonstrates an effort to submit a timely request or due to events beyond the control of the provider, a prior authorization was not obtained; e.g., a hospital discharge, outside of business hours, etc. An explanation of the delay in submission must accompany the PA request and include any supporting documentation with a request for an exception. Providers may not bill Medicaid participants for services not reimbursed by Medicaid because the PA was not obtained in a timely manner or because the provider failed to verify that a PA was required. If an individual is not eligible for Medicaid at the time items or services requiring a PA were provided but was subsequently found eligible pursuant to retroactive Medicaid eligibility, a request must be submitted with all required documentation within 30 days of the date the July 1, 2025 Page 19 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions provider became aware of the individual’s Medicaid eligibility. The item or service will be reviewed by the Department retroactively using the same medical necessity guidelines that apply to other prior authorization requests. If approved, the provider should refund any amount previously collected from the participant for the item or service to the participant. The Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook contains addresses and telephone numbers for entities that review prior authorizations. Depending on the service, a PA may be received from the: • Division of Medicaid Central Office • Regional Developmental Disabilities Program • Bureau of Long Term Care (BLTC) • Telligen, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Participants with Medicare as their primary insurance do not require a PA from Idaho Medicaid for Medicare approved items and services. If the services are not covered by Medicare, or the participant has another primary payor, prior authorizations from Medicaid are required as if the participant had Medicaid primary. 1.9.1 References: Prior Authorization (a) CMS Guidance Medicaid Program; Face-to-Face Requirements for Home Health Services; Policy Changes and Clarifications Related to Home Health, 81 Federal Register 5,530 (February 2, 2016).

July 1, 2025 Page 21 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.9.2 Medicaid Prior Authorization Idaho Medicaid issues a written notification of authorization or denial for all written requests for prior authorization (PA). Notices include PA numbers and may include modifiers which must be used when billing for approved services. To render a service that requires a Medicaid PA, download and complete the appropriate form. Fax the form and documentation justifying the medical necessity of the procedure to the fax number on the form. Direct all requests for PAs to the appropriate contractor or Department unit as listed in the Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. The requests should include: • Participant name and Medicaid Identification (MID) number • Signed physician’s order • A list of all items and a price quote for each • Prescriber’s statement of diagnosis and medical necessity for applicable drugs • Requesting provider • Additional information as identified by the reviewing entity Prior Authorization Dates of Service The PA letter indicates the length of time the authorization is valid. The dates of service billed must occur on or after the start date and on or before the expiration date indicated on the PA letter. If the PA expiration date occurs before services are provided, a new PA must be requested. To prevent a disruption or break in service to the participant, request a PA as soon as the need for additional services is identified. Modifiers and Prior Authorization (PA) The PA letter will specify when a modifier has been added to the PA. Modifiers are used to increase accuracy in compensation, coding consistency, editing, and to capture payment data. At times, reviewers for Idaho Medicaid may attach a modifier to a procedure code when a PA is approved. When a provider receives notification of an approved PA, it is essential to check the authorization to determine if a modifier is attached to any of the approved procedure codes. If there is a modifier attached to any approved code on the approved PA, that modifier must be used when billing for the service or the claim will deny. Modifiers other than those listed on the approved PA may also be appropriate in billing for the service and should be included on the claim. Prior Authorization (PA) Forms PA forms for many service and provider types can be found on the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. Specific prior authorization instructions can be found in the specific provider type handbook. Physician Administered Drugs (PAD) Requiring PA Certain PADs require prior authorization.

The notice includes information on their appeal rights and how to request a hearing. Providers do not have appeal rights for PAs; however, they may submit additional documentation for reconsideration of their request. Providers must include the prior authorization number on their request for it to be considered with the previous documentation.

Reconsiderations shall be requested within 28 days of the Department’s decision. Providers must include the PA number on the request and include previous documentation for it to be considered. If the PA number is not provided, a denial may be issued for an incomplete request. Reconsiderations are submitted to the same reviewer as the original request when possible. Upon completion of the reconsideration review, Idaho Medicaid or its designee will issue a second Notice of Decision for Medical Benefits. If the provider or participant disagrees with the PA reconsideration decision made by Idaho Medicaid or its designee, they may file a Request for Appeal. The provider or participant has 28 days from the mailing date of the second Notice of Decision for Medical Benefits to submit a formal appeal. (b) Telligen Reconsiderations Advisory letters sent from Telligen to physicians, hospitals, and participants provide two (2) options for appeals, Reconsiderations and Department Appeals.

July 1, 2025 Page 28 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.9.8 Transferring a Prior Authorization Participants have the right to choose their provider and may change providers at any time. There are some exceptions such as the Healthy Connections program. The initial prior authorization (PA) does not automatically transfer when the participant chooses a new provider. The participant or their parent or guardian is required to contact the issuing authority verbally or in writing of their intent to change providers. Transfers through Telligen require the newly selected provider to submit an updated Prior Authorization Form indicating the request is for a transfer. Supporting documentation is not necessary to transfer an existing PA. July 1, 2025 Page 29 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.10 Professional and Technical Components Certain procedures are a combination of a physician or other qualified health care professional component and a technical component. The professional and technical components together are referred to as the “global service”. Professional (26) and technical (TC) component modifiers were established for some services to distinguish the portion of a service provided by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional. The technical component includes charges for personnel and materials, space, equipment, and other facility charges and is generally billed by the entity that provides the testing equipment. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® of HCPCS code with the TC modifier to identify a charge for the technical component. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® or HCPCS code with the 26 modifier to identify a charge for the professional component of a diagnostic service/procedure which includes supervision, interpretation, and a written report.

The technical component includes charges for personnel and materials, space, equipment, and other facility charges and is generally billed by the entity that provides the testing equipment. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® of HCPCS code with the TC modifier to identify a charge for the technical component. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® or HCPCS code with the 26 modifier to identify a charge for the professional component of a diagnostic service/procedure which includes supervision, interpretation, and a written report. If the technical and professional components of a service are performed by the same provider, the service would be billed using the appropriate CPT code without modifier 26 or TC. The introduction of the American Medical Association, CPT, 2016 edition, defines results, testing, interpretation, and report and states: “Results are the technical component of a service. Testing leads to results; results lead to interpretation. Reports are the work product of the interpretation of test results. Certain procedures or services described in a CPT involve a technical component (e.g.; tests) which produces “results” (e.g.; data; images, slides). For clinical use, some of these results require interpretation. Some CPT descriptors specifically require interpretation and reporting to report that code.” There are CPT codes that describe professional-only and technical-only services that would be billed without a 26 or TC modifier. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Professional Component/Technical Component indicators in the National Physician Fee Schedule (NPFS) Relative Value File can be used to help determine whether a CPT code is eligible for separate reimbursement for professional and technical services. 1.10.1 References: Professional and Technical Components (a) Idaho Medicaid Publications “Medicaid Program Integrity Unit: Correct Billing for Procedures with Professional and Technical Components.” MedicAide Newsletter, November 2016, https://www.idmedicaid.com/MedicAide%20Newsletters/November%202016%20MedicAide. pdf. July 1, 2025 Page 30 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 1.11 Manually Priced Goods and Services Procedure codes which appear on the Medicaid Numerical Fee Schedule with a reimbursement amount of $0.00 must have the appropriate documentation for the code to be priced correctly with the exception of pharmaceuticals on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), 340B supplied pharmaceuticals, and anesthesia codes. If the code is prior authorized and not a pharmaceutical, the documentation must be sent with the prior authorization request. If the code is not prior authorized, then the documentation must be attached to the claim. Services on claims or authorization requests without the required attachments will deny. Documentation must be legible and not handwritten. Providers can only alter documentation from third parties when multiple items or services are listed and it’s necessary to draw attention to the item or service being provided, or to cover lines that do not apply to the current request. Amounts invoiced directly to the Department must be at the provider’s usual and customary rate, which is the amount the provider charges to Medicare beneficiaries and other patients liable for such charges, as supported by the provider’s records. This amount must be adjusted to reflect the provider’s billing policies so that the amount reflects what the provider receives through reasonable collection efforts. Pharmaceuticals listed on the WAC list, except those supplied as 340B drugs, are paid at the lower of the provider’s charges or the WAC price for the drug. 340B drugs are paid at the provider’s charge. No documentation is necessary for items on the WAC list or from 340B supplies. To accurately price all other drugs, provide the actual amount given to the patient when billing. Pharmaceuticals not on the WAC list are priced using the tangible goods methodology. In addition to the methodology’s required documentation, for pricing providers must supply: • The description of the procedure code or its billable units (i.e. 1mg); and • An explanation of the units billed on the service line (i.e. 32 units billed for procedure code measured at 1mg to indicate 32mg were provided). Genetic laboratory tests, imaging, radiology and surgical procedures are priced by the Medical Care Unit based off the submitted documentation. Acceptable documentation for these services includes an invoice on letterhead with: • The Department as the entity being invoiced; • The Idaho Medicaid provider as the invoicing entity; • A date of invoice (Dates after the date of service are acceptable); • For genetic testing use the date the specimen was obtained, or the test was ordered, or for surgical procedures the date of the surgery; and • The service provided and corresponding procedure code. Tangible goods are priced at cost + 10% + shipping for pricing using invoices, or 75% of the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). Documentation cannot be handwritten. Documentation is unacceptable if its date is after the date of service except where otherwise noted. Acceptable documentation for tangible goods",

For an Idaho Medicaid claim to be considered as filed on a timely basis, the complete claim must be submitted, and an Internal Control Number (ICN) assigned within 12 months (365 days) of the start date of service or in the case of an institutional claim from the through date of service. There are three exceptions to this requirement: 1) Services for dually eligible participants (those who have both Medicare and Medicaid) provided through fee-for-service network provider must be billed to Idaho Medicaid within 12 months (365 days) of the start date of service or six (6) months of the date of payment/date of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN), whichever is greater. (See the Medicare Processing section for more information on processing paid or denied Medicare claims.) 2) If the participant is approved for Medicaid coverage after the date of service, DHW issues a detailed Notice of Action (NOA) explaining the retroactive eligibility. To be considered within the timely filing limits, the claim for this participant must be submitted within 12 months (365 days) of the notice date on the letter. (See the Participant Retroactive Eligibility section for more information.) 3) Inpatient claims with a length of stay exceeding 12 months (365 days)",

Documentation accepted for an exception to timely filing includes: • Paper claims which require an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from Medicare and display the paid date • Retro Eligibility document/Notice of Action for the participant • County Indigent Fund Notification When you send an EOB from any payer for any reason, it must include the other payer’s processing information to support the submitted claim. Additional required documentation from the other payer is the page which explains the applicable remark codes, so the payment/denial information can be correctly interpreted. The documentation can be mailed with a paper claim or scanned and attached to your Health PAS-Online entry.

The retroactive eligibility approval letter, also called the Notice of Action, should be attached, if available, to the claim for timely filing documentation. If the notice is unavailable, the provider should write and attach a letter attesting to when and how they received notification of the participant’s eligibility, and request Gainwell Technologies review the claim under retroactive eligibility for timely filing. If the claim is denied the claim review process may be used for further consideration.

See Third Party Liability for more information about Duals. Providers must bill Medicare first for services and follow their billing requirements. If Medicare denies a claim for timely filing, Medicaid will also deny it for timely filing. Most of the time claims processed by Medicare are sent electronically to Medicaid for processing. These electronically forwarded claims are called crossover claims. If the Medicare claim is not included in the electronic crossover or for those situations where it is necessary to bill Medicaid after Medicare has paid, it is necessary to submit a paper claim or an electronic claim within 6 months of the date of the Medicare payment or denial. That date will be the date of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)/Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN). The applicable EOB/MRN should be attached to the claim; be sure to include the page with the processing information about the claim you are submitting and the page that explains the applicable remark codes.

The Department generally reimburses at the lesser of billed charges or the established reimbursement cap for the item or service. When there are retrospective rate increases or decreases, the adjusted rates are added to the system and DHW initiates mass adjustments to previously paid claims for that time period that the rates have been adjusted. If the original claim was billed at the Medicaid allowed amount and the rate is increased retrospectively, the adjusted claim will pay at the original billed amount. The provider will not receive additional reimbursement. The Office of the Inspector General may exclude any provider from receiving money from the Medicare and Medicaid programs if they are found to be billing substantially more than their usual charges or costs for services and items. 1.13.1 References: Usual and Customary Fees (a) Idaho Medicaid Publications “Why is it Necessary to Bill Usual and Customary Charges.” MedicAide Newsletter, November 2008.

Common errors that are made when entering the name on the claim form include: • Spelling mistakes and typing errors; • Name not entered in correct order, or the participant may use a hyphenated last name; • When entering a two-word last name, not starting with the lead name.

Required Coding Idaho Medicaid uses codes as listed in the most current version of: • Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)® from the American Medical Association (AMA); • Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature (CDT)® from the American Dental Association (ADA)®; • Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); • International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) from the World Health Organization (WHO); and • International Classification of Diseases Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) from the World Health Organization (WHO). Providers are expected to select a code from one of these sets that best defines the service provided. The provider must bill the most specific code to the service provided. As part of correct coding requirements, miscellaneous, not otherwise classified or unlisted codes should not be used if specific codes are available. Only exceptions published by Idaho Medicaid are permitted. While",

The global surgical package applies to physicians, or qualified non-physician healthcare professionals, services in any setting, including inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center and physician office. Modifier 25 is appended to an evaluation and management (E&M) code when a significant separately identifiable service is provided by the same physician or other qualified healthcare professional on the same day of the procedure or other service. E&M performed on the same date as a minor procedure are usually included in the payment for the procedure regardless of if the provider performing the E&M and surgeon are different so long as they’re in the same group. The service provided with a modifier 25 must be unrelated to the decision to have a surgery. The diagnoses for the E&M and procedure do not have to be different to qualify separately from the global.

July 1, 2025 Page 75 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions Modifier 59: Separate Encounters and Distinct 3.3.17 Procedures NCCI Procedure-to-Procedure (PTP) edits with a Correct Coding Modifier Indicator (CCMI) of “1” allow providers to use modifiers to indicate medical necessity for procedures or services that would usually not be reported together, but in particular circumstances are appropriate. Modifier 59 is often inappropriately billed and must be used per the criteria of this section. The Modifier cannot be used to simply bypass the NCCI edit. Providers must have documentation supporting the use of Modifier 59. Documentation must support a different session, different procedure or surgery (i.e., different session or site), different site or organ system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in extensive injuries) not ordinarily encountered or performed on the same day by the same individual. Contiguous structures in the same organ or anatomic region do not constitute treatment of different anatomic sites. Services with modifier 59 do not require a different diagnosis from the conflicting procedure. Modifier 59 may be used for two timed codes provided in the same session as long as the services are provided sequentially. There must be a clear end to the services in one code before services in the other code begin. Modifier 59 may be used for, but is not limited to, anesthesia services. Modifier 59 must only be used for a diagnostic procedure which precedes a therapeutic procedure when the diagnostic is used as a basis to decide to perform the therapeutic procedure. In order to qualify the diagnostic cannot: • Overlap with a therapeutic intervention or services required for one; • Be a service that would otherwise be required for the intervention; or • Be an inherent component of a surgical procedure. Modifier 59 must only be used for a diagnostic procedure after a therapeutic procedure when the diagnostic is not a common or necessary follow-up to the procedure. In order to qualify the diagnostic cannot: • Overlap with a therapeutic intervention or services required for one; • Be a service that would otherwise be required for the intervention; or • Be an inherent component of a surgical procedure. If another modifier is appropriate, it must always be used instead of modifier 59. This includes modifiers that are more anatomically specific, such as RT, LT, F1-F9, etc., and modifiers XE, XS, XP and XU, which were created to replace most of the functions modifier 59 supplies. Modifier 59 should never be used for evaluation and management services. (a)",

July 1, 2025 Page 79 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.3.2 Modifier 76: Repeat Procedure Modifier 76 (repeat procedure by the same physician) is used for multiple or identical services provided to a participant on the same day. When billing with modifier 76, the first claim line with the code should not contain the modifier. The modifier should appear on the subsequent code. A service repeated multiple times that would be billed with modifier 76 should have all units after the first unit billed on a single line. The Modifier must not be used to simply bypass a duplication of service edit. Example For three EKGs provided to the participant on the same day the claim lines would be billed: Example of Modifier 76 Date(s) of Procedure Modifier Units Service Code 01/01/2024 93010 N/A 1 01/01/2024 93010 76 2 Modifier 76 may be used for, but is not limited to, physician services including anesthesia and surgical services.

July 1, 2025 Page 86 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.3.7 Modifier JW: Medical Waste of Drugs and Biologicals The JW modifier is used on Medicare Part B claims with drugs or biologicals from single use vials and packages. Single-use products are only intended for use by a single patient or procedure. The modifier is appended on claim lines for units that are not administered to a patient, and must be discarded as wastage. Wastage is defined as the amount of a drug or biologic leftover in a vial or package after a portion of the same vial or package is administered to a Medicaid participant. Idaho Medicaid covers the wastage of drug or biological products administered by injection or infusion using the JW modifier for drugs and biologics billed using C, J, Q or S HCPCS codes. Wastage is only reimbursable for drugs or biologics that only come in a single-use vial or package as identified by the manufacturer. Drugs that are available in a multi-dose vial or package are not available for wastage reimbursement. Reimbursement is limited to the difference between the amount ordered/administered for the participant and the minimum amount needed to equal the nearest whole vial or package. The nearest whole vial or package is calculated using the vial or package size and dose that results in the least amount of waste available on the market. If possible, administered doses should be rounded to the nearest vial to avoid wastage. Examples If the physician orders 100 mg of a drug, and the drug is manufactured in both a 50 mg single-use vial and a 150 mg single-use vial, then no wastage is reimbursable as two 50 mg vials meet the amount ordered. If the physician orders 180 mg of a drug, and the drug is manufactured in both a 100 mg single-use vial and a 150 mg single-use vial, then Idaho Medicaid will only reimburse for 20 mg of wastage, the result of using two 100",

If the provider only has 150 mg single-use vials on the date of service, 120 mg will be wasted. However, Idaho Medicaid will still only reimburse for 20 mg of wastage. The remaining 100 mg of wasted drug is excess wastage that is not eligible for reimbursement. The 100 mg becomes a business expense or loss incurred by the provider due to not having the 100 mg vials available when needed. Reimbursement is not available for: • Drugs and biologics in excess of what is ordered and billed without the JW modifier; • Drugs and biologics in excess of the minimum wastage amount possible per this policy; • Drugs and biologics available in multi-dose vials or multi-use packages; • Drugs and biologics discarded due to expiration when no amount of the discarded vial or pack was administered to the participant; • Wastage of an amount less than a whole unit of billing per the HCPCS code’s long description; • Drugs and biologics in which any portion of the vial or package was administered to a patient other than the Medicaid participant. This includes another Medicaid participant; • Drugs and biologics that require a prior authorization for which no prior authorization was obtained; • Drugs and biologics included in the encounter rate for Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC); • Drugs and biologics not purchased by the practice site (e.g. study drugs provided by the study sponsor and compassionate use programs); • Medication waste resulting from overfill of the single dose vial; July 1, 2025 Page 87 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions • Medication waste resulting from a missed/failed patient visit; • Skin substitutes; and • Drug and biologic wastage for the same drug or biologic from multiple single-use vials or packages opened during the same encounter. The medical record for claims with the JW modifier must contain the following information on the drug: • The authorized prescriber order; o Orders with dosages based on specific measurements such as weight, surface area, etc., must include those measurements; • The amount of drug or biologic administered; and • The amount of drug or biologic discarded or wasted; o Must include date and time of disposal; o The reason for disposal; and o The name, licensure, and signature of the person discarding the drug or biologic. Claims for drug or biologic wastage must be billed on the same claim as the administered portion of the drug. Wastage in compliance with this section is billed on a separate line item with the modifier JW. The date of service for this claim line must be the last covered administration according to the plan of care or if the participant dies, the date of death.

July 1, 2025 Page 99 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.4 Diagnosis Codes Idaho Medicaid only accepts diagnosis codes identified in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) from the World Health Organization (WHO). The claims processing system requires all diagnosis on claims codes be entered with the decimal point. This applies to paper, electronic or online/direct data entry claims. Claims should be coded to the highest level of specificity. Unspecified diagnoses codes should be the exception. Some services are restricted in the provider handbook or posted policies for specific circumstances as identified by diagnoses codes. If an unspecified code does not appear on these lists, but is the appropriate diagnoses, check the policy or handbook with the restriction for instructions on alternate billing options. For example, some policies may allow claims with a KX modifier for uncovered diagnoses. If alternate billing options aren’t provided: • For inpatient hospital stays, please, follow Telligen’s default processes. • For other claims follow the claim review and Medicaid review process. 3.4.1 References: Diagnosis Codes (a) Federal Regulations Code Sets, 45 C.F.R.

For example, a participant’s stay is 01/01/2018 to 01/31/2018, and new ICD-10 codes become effective 01/16/2018. Claim #1 should have the original diagnosis for 01/01/2018 to 01/15/2018.

July 1, 2025 Page 101 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.5 National Correct Coding Initiative The National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) is a program developed by CMS that uses correct coding methodologies to reduce overpayments to providers due to incorrect coding on claims. NCCI edits are comprised of Procedure-to-Procedure Edits and Medically Unlikely Edits. Section 6507 of the Affordable Care Act directed all State Medicaid programs to implement use of NCCI methodologies that are “compatible” with claims filed with Medicaid. This is to promote correct coding and control improper coding leading to inappropriate payment of claims under Medicaid. Idaho may not override an edit through the prior authorization process. However, an edit may be overridden through the claim reconsideration and appeals process. The state may seek an exemption from CMS for an individual code only when the MUE is contrary to state policy, such as the case where Idaho instructs a provider to bill in 15-minute increments and the national code description does not designate a time frame for the code. NCCI edits are updated on a quarterly basis, with new edits added each quarter. For additional information and instruction as well as lists of current edits, providers should access the Medicaid NCCI page. 3.5.1 References: National Correct Coding Initiative (a) CMS Guidance Medicaid NCCI Technical Guidance Manual, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.cms.gov/ncci-medicaid/medicaid-ncci-technical-guidance-manual.

July 1, 2025 Page 102 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.5.2 Procedure-to-Procedure (PTP) Edits Procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits define pairs of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)® and HCPCS codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons. One reason a combination may not be allowed is that one code is considered a component of another. These edits apply to claims with a combination of the same participant, provider and date of service.

July 1, 2025 Page 103 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 3.5.3 Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE) Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs), or units-of-service edits, define for each CPT® and HCPCS code the number of units of service that would be medically necessary for most participants in most situations. Services that exceed an MUE will be denied. However, if services are medically necessary beyond the MUE, providers can bill additional units on another claim line with the SC modifier. This modifier indicates that the provider has reviewed the medical documentation and determined additional services are medically necessary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented an outpatient hospital MUE of zero to any services that should be limited to an inpatient hospital setting to ensure patient safety. Procedure codes with an MUE of zero for outpatient hospital procedures can be found at CMS.gov under the National Correct Coding Initiative. Modifiers cannot be used to override the zero MUE.

Claim Submission Providers may submit claims by: • Electronic Data Interchange (EDI); • Direct data entry (DDE) into Health PAS-Online, Trading Partner Account (TPA); and • By mail on original, preprinted paper claim forms. Electronic claim submission has many benefits, including a reduced number of errors, faster payments, and easier claim tracking. Once a completed claim is submitted it is assigned a claim number. Claim numbers begin with the two-digit year and three-digit day-of-the-year to denote the date the claim was received. Claims that are adjusted or reversed will retain the date the original claim was submitted to ensure compliance with timely filing. Adjusted claims will have an A1 suffix, while reversed claims will have an R1 suffix. 4.1 References: Claim Submission 4.1.1 Idaho Medicaid Publications “Educational Tip – Claim # Formatting.” MedicAide Newsletter, February 2024, https://www.idmedicaid.com/MedicAide%20Newsletters/February%202024%20MedicAide.p df. July 1, 2025 Page 105 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 4.2 Electronic Claims Submission All providers must register as trading partners with Gainwell Technologies (GWT) via the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. Registration includes electronically signing a trading partner agreement for HIPAA compliance in order to receive a trading partner ID, which is used on the X12 transactions as an identifier of the submitting provider. Registering as a trading partner will also allow you access to the secure portion of the website for all real time claim entries, inquiries, and status requests. The secure website allows for ease of access to reports including the remittance advice. Please see the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide in the User Guides online. GWT offers two methods for electronic claims submission. 1. EDI is a HIPAA compliant X12 claim transaction referred to as an 837, which is submitted using online File Exchange upload. For EDI claim submission and billing instructions, please refer to the appropriate HIPAA X12 Vendor Specifications Companion Guides located at Health PAS-Online at www.idmedicaid.com. Electronic claims that are not in the correct HIPAA compliant format will be rejected. 2. DDE is the web-based entry of claims into the Health PAS-Online secure provider portal.

When billing electronically, providers must complete all HIPAA required data elements; however, not all of the information is used by Idaho Medicaid in claims processing. The following HIPAA required data elements for an electronic HIPAA 837 claim submission are not used by Idaho Medicaid. • Release of medical data • Benefit assignment • Patient signature • Social Security number • Tax ID number and qualifier • Entity type qualifiers • Provider and participant address • Participant ID qualifier • Participant date of birth • Participant gender July 1, 2025 Page 106 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 4.2.1 Vendor Software and Clearinghouses Providers subject to Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) requirements can use EVV software from any EVV vendor after it is tested and certified as compliant with the MMIS Aggregator managed by Sandata. Software vendors are not allowed to test their product with Gainwell Technologies (GWT) Medicaid Solutions. GWT will not endorse any specific software application. Any testing of third party software must be performed by a registered provider. Contact the GWT Technical Help Desk if you have any questions regarding this process. Providers who wish to bill electronically and who bill more than one insurance carrier should consider using a clearinghouse. Clearinghouses are private companies that handle insurance claims for multiple carriers. The advantage for the provider is that claims are entered only once for the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse then forwards the claim to the appropriate insurance carriers (including Idaho Medicaid). A list of all currently registered Clearinghouses and Billing Agencies is available on Health PAS-Online by selecting the link titled Registered Clearinghouses and Billing Agencies. GWT will furnish the specifications, free of charge, to any vendor upon request. Once the clearinghouse has successfully transmitted enough test data to become production certified with the MMIS, providers using their services may begin using the clearinghouse to submit claims. Since providers use a variety of different billing software brands, it is not possible to give exact information on how to complete any specific electronic eligibility or claim form. Providers can review the EDI Companion Guides, available on the Idaho GWT Medicaid website, for a general example of HIPAA-compliant electronic transaction formats. See the next section for details about registering as a trading partner to begin testing. July 1, 2025 Page 107 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 4.3 Paper Claim Forms Several different types of claim forms are used to bill services to Medicaid. The following forms are the only paper forms accepted by Idaho Medicaid: • CMS 1500 (Red drop out form) • UB-04 (Red drop out form) All paper claims are electronically scanned for processing. The printed versions of the claim forms are machine readable which means they are printed using special paper, special color inks, and within precise specifications. For this reason, only original color forms can be used for scanning. Forms that cannot be scanned are returned to the provider. To ensure paper claims are scanned correctly, follow these guidelines: • Use the specified original claim form referenced above. Photocopies cannot be scanned and will be returned to the provider. • Check the Claim Form Instructions;CMS-1500 Instructions or the UB04-Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbooks for your specific provider type for the required fields. • Do not enter any data or documentation on the claim form not listed as required. When billing Medicaid there is no need to enter data into fields that are not required. • Use black ink or a typewriter with a good ribbon or a printer with a good ink cartridge. Change the ribbon or ink source if the print is too light. • When using a typewriter or printer, make sure the form is lined up correctly, so it prints evenly. Claims cannot be processed when the information is not in the correct field or not within the box. If completing the form by hand, print neatly. • Be sure to stay within the box for each field. • When entering an X in a check-off box, be sure that the mark is centered in the box. • White correction fluid is acceptable, but no other alterations should be made on the form. • Do not use bold font. Do not staple or paper clip any attachments to the claim form.",

Do not staple or paper clip any attachments to the claim form. Check the Provider Guidelines for your specific provider type handbook to see if an attachment is required. Providers have the option to upload claim attachments through the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website when entering claims through a Trading Partner Account (TPA). Attachments should be scanned completed forms, word processing, or spreadsheet documents. If an attachment is required, providers can continue to send claims via US mail. Do not fold the form.

July 1, 2025 Page 109 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 4.4 Attachments Attachments are additional documentation required to support the processing and payment of a claim. Please ensure all attachments are legible. Attachments may include: • Third Party Explanation of Benefits (EOB) • Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN)/Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB) • Certificate of Medical Necessity CMS-484—Oxygen (CMN) • Pharmacy prescription • Consent forms • Manufacturer’s MSRP • Manufacturer’s invoice showing provider cost and shipping as applicable If a claim has an attachment, do not staple or clip it to the claim. Place it behind the claim form, as illustrated in the figure to the left. If multiple claims refer to the same attachment, then make separate copies of the attachment for each claim. If multiple claims are sent together, then stack the claims with each claim followed by its own attachment(s). See the diagram at left. If an attachment has information on both sides of the page, then make a copy of the backside and include it with the claim. If an attachment such as a sales receipt is on a small slip of paper, then copy or tape it onto an 8 ½” by 11” inch piece of paper. If the submission is related to timely filing, it is required that you attach the Medicaid RA. If the submission is a claim review request or the like, attaching the RA will help explain the history of the claim and previous processing. If no attachments are required, then consider submitting the claim electronically.

Providers can determine the status of their claims through Gainwell Technologies in four ways: • Through the weekly Remittance Advice (RA). See Remittance Advice Analysis, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for information on RAs. • Calling Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) at 1 (866) 686-4272. • The electronic claim status request and response transaction (HIPAA 276/277). • Online through the Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website. Questions specific to a claim in a denied status must use the secure messaging option through the provider’s trading partner account. MACS Inquiry: Providers can check the status of electronic and paper claims sent to Gainwell Technologies for processing by calling MACS and selecting the claims information option. For more information on how to access MACS and check claim status, refer to the MACS User Guide in the User Guides on the Idaho GWT Medicaid website. Electronic Inquiry: Idaho Medicaid supports the HIPAA transaction known as the 276/277, Electronic Claim Status Inquiry and Response. This transaction allows providers to inquire on the status of claims and health plans to return the requested information. Providers should contact their software vendor or clearinghouse to determine if their vendor supports the claim status inquiry and response transactions. Online Inquiry: This option is available to providers who have a trading partner account. More information about verifying eligibility online can be found in the Eligibility Verification section of the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide. Potential claim statuses include: • DENY: The claim or claim line has been denied for reimbursement. A remittance message will be included with more information on why. • PAY: The claim line is approved to pay. • PEND: The claim requires manual review by a Claims Resolution Specialist, and will change to a PAY or DENY status once completed. July 1, 2025 Page 112 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 5. Adjustments Adjustments are permitted on a claim only if the information on the original claim is updated. Adjustments cannot be used to add additional services or units, or change the date of service or billed charges. If the claim requires additional line items, or changes to the initial date of service, a new claim is required. Providers have two (2) years from the start date of service to adjust a claim except for institutional claims and Medicare crossover claims. Institutional claims have two (2) years from the through date of service. Medicare crossover claims have two (2) years from the date of the Medicare Remittance Notice. Documentation should be included to support timely filing. In accordance with the provider agreement, providers are required to immediately repay identified overpayments. For claims that are under two (2) years old from the applicable date, providers must adjust their own claims via an EDI 837 transaction or through their Trading Partner Account (TPA). For those providers who do not have the capability to use either method, a Claim Review Request Form must be submitted stating in the Comments field why the provider is unable to adjust the claim electronically; additionally, the provider must also request the claim be reversed, and include a new modified claim form with the Claim Review Request Form, located on the Forms page of Gainwell Technologies’ (GWT’s) Idaho Medicaid website. For providers seeking to adjust claims that are beyond two (2) years old from the applicable date, it is considered a recoupment. For these claims, you must refund via check for both partial and complete recoupments and include the Overpayment Form located on the Forms page of GWT’s Idaho Medicaid website. The Remittance Advice (RA) will show any adjustments made.

Attachments can be submitted via EDI and attachments are necessary to support and explain the adjustment. Please see the Claim Status section of the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide for instructions. When submitting electronic adjustments, use claim frequency 8 to void a claim or claim frequency 7 to replace a claim. 5.3 Paper Adjustments When a claim is paid incorrectly, resubmit a completed claim form indicating the original claim number and claim frequency code. If resubmitting on a CMS 1500, the frequency code of eight (8) to void a claim, or claim frequency seven (7) to replace a claim is placed in Field/Box 22 along with the original claim number. If resubmitting on a UB-04 claim form, the last digit of the bill type is considered the frequency code. In Field/Box 4, the bill type must show a seven (7) or eight (8) in the frequency position and the original claim number in Field/Box 64. See the Claim Form Instructions for detailed information. July 1, 2025 Page 114 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 6. Claim Reconsideration and Appeals Claim reconsideration and appeals follow this process: • Step 1: Claim Review Request; • Step 2: Medicaid Review of Claim Determination; • Step 3: Formal Appeal. July 1, 2025 Page 115 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 6.1 Claim Review Request The Claim Review Request (CRR) process is available to providers who want Gainwell Technologies (GWT) to physically review their claims. CRRs must be submitted within two (2) years of the date of service, or the through date for facility claims. A CRR is used when: • The provider disagrees with a timely filing denial. • The provider disagrees with the application of Coordination of Benefits (COB). • The provider disagrees with the denial or payment amount of a claim and wants a manual review. • The claim denied for bundling issues against a denied claim line. • The claim was inappropriately denied as a duplicate claim. • The claim was inappropriately denied for exceeding a lifetime benefit. • A condition on the Hospital-Acquired Conditions was not caused by a lack of appropriate care or inappropriate treatment. • A claim for delivering a newborn is denied for a participant under the age of 13. • A claim was submitted for organ donor costs for a deceased Medicaid participant. • A participant lost eligibility in the middle of a covered stay and then resumed eligibility. • A revenue code and CPT®/HCPCS combination is not in the claims processing system. While CRRs can be used for many reasons but should not be used in these instances: • The claim needs to be adjusted or additional documentation attached. Examples of documents include: Explanation of Benefits (EOB), invoice, sterilization/hysterectomy consent forms, NOA for timely filing, or run/trip report. • The provider has concerns with Share of Cost (SOC). • The provider wants more information on Health Management Systems (HMS) adjustments or recoupments. • The provider wants to request recoupment for a claim within the two (2) year adjustment period. • The provider is adjusting a claim after a change in the participant’s eligibility. It is best practice for providers to use the provider portal to reverse and adjust claims when necessary, to attach documentation, or reprocess the claim, especially in the instances noted above when a CRR is not used. Please reference the section titled Reverse or Adjust a Claim in the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide for more information on navigating the provider portal. For overpayments, see Adjustments. The CRR instructions and form are found on GWT’s website under the Reference Material tab under Forms – Gainwell Technologies Forms. Check Claim Review Request on the Claim Review Request Form and complete the necessary information. The form must be completed in blue or black ink and follow all instructions for it to be processed.

Third Party Liability This section covers the Third-Party Liability (TPL) situations applicable to providers working with Idaho Medicaid participants. It briefly describes how Gainwell Technologies (GWT) processes TPR claims. In accordance with Federal regulations 42 CFR-433.135-139, the Division of Medicaid or its designee must take all reasonable measures to determine the legal liability of third parties to pay for medical services under the plan. A third party is any insurance company, private individual, corporation, or business that can be held legally responsible for the payment of all or part of the medical or dental costs of a participant. Third parties could include: • Medicare; • Group health insurance; • Workers’ compensation; • Homeowners’ or renters’ insurance; • Automobile liability insurance; • Non-custodial parents and/or their insurance carriers; or • An individual found legally responsible for a Medicaid participant’s injury (a person who committed an assault on a participant, for instance). Federal regulations require providers to bill all known insurance companies before submitting a claim to Medicaid. At",

Third parties could include: • Medicare; • Group health insurance; • Workers’ compensation; • Homeowners’ or renters’ insurance; • Automobile liability insurance; • Non-custodial parents and/or their insurance carriers; or • An individual found legally responsible for a Medicaid participant’s injury (a person who committed an assault on a participant, for instance). Federal regulations require providers to bill all known insurance companies before submitting a claim to Medicaid. At this time, services federally excluded from TPR requirements are: • Indian Health Services (IHS); • Purchased or Referred Care (PRC) healthcare by IHS; • Health insurance plans self-funded by a federally recognized tribe; • School-based services; • Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) or the crime victim’s compensation programs; • The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP); and • Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and testing (EPSDT) services, when a liable third party has not made payment within 90 days after the date the provider of such services initially submitted a claim to such third party for payment for such services, in accordance with section 1902(a)(25)(E) of the Social Security Act. Screening and diagnosis program services include: o Age-appropriate exams, including comprehensive health and developmental history, growth, development, and nutritional status, provided in accordance with reasonable standards of medical and dental practice; o Medically necessary behavioral health services; o Immunizations; o Laboratory tests; and o Diagnosis of defects of vision, hearing, dental needs, and other health conditions for participants under the age of 21. Based on these regulatory requirements, Idaho Medicaid is the primary payer for the following third-party insurers: • 6243 SHASTA ADMIN SERVICES-INDIAN HEALTH • 6233 HEALTHCARE MGT ADMIN - AN/AI Services for treatment of individuals under the age of 21 are not excluded from TPL requirements except where noted. The provider must accept the Medicaid allowed amount as payment in full. The provider cannot bill the participant for any balance remaining after the primary insurance and Medicaid have both paid. This also includes claims with third-party liability where Medicaid’s July 1, 2025 Page 120 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions reimbursement methodology considers the third-party payment to have covered the claim in full and no additional amount is paid by Medicaid. See the Participant Financial Responsibility section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for when billing a participant is allowed. 7.1 References: Third Party Liability 7.1.1 CMS Guidance “Coordination between Medicaid and Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programs.” CMCS Informational Bulletin, May 1, 2013, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/cib-05- 01-2013.pdf. “Further Guidance to Medicaid Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2018 and changes to Medicaid Provisions Passed in April 2019 – Third Party Liability in Medicaid and CHIP.” CMCS Informational Bulletin, November 14, 2019, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy- guidance/downloads/cib111419.pdf. “Opportunities to Improve HIV Testing, Prevention, and Care Delivery for Medicaid and CHIP Beneficiaries.” CMCS Informational Bulletin, January 15, 2025, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/cib01152025.pdf. 7.1.2 Federal Regulations Acceptance of State Payment as Payment in Full, 42 CFR 447.15 (2013).

July 1, 2025 Page 124 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.3 Coordination of Benefits (COB) Coordination of Benefits (COB) is how Idaho Medicaid determines payment for claims when a third-party is liable for a portion of the charges. The COB calculation is performed at the claim level for all claims to determine the payment for claims with a third-party insurer. COB calculation is not performed line by line. COB amounts entered at the claim detail level are summed up for the claim and then the COB calculation is performed. The payment is then distributed to the claim detail lines. The Department is not liable for penalties levied against a provider by a third-party payor. Any amount deducted from a payor’s reimbursement for a penalty will not be included in the COB calculation. For example, if Medicare decreases reimbursement on a claim due to a penalty, the amount used in the COB calculation is what Medicare would have reimbursed if no penalty was applied. Third Party Recovery claims are claims that HMS has recovered payment on from a participant’s primary insurance payer, who was unknown at the time the original claim was paid. The amount HMS recovered from the other payer is reflected as a primary insurance payment amount on the Remittance Advice and provider portal. An eligibility segment will be displayed reflecting either Third Party Recovery or Casualty for participants on the portal. Claims marked as Casualty indicate a settlement has been reached in an accident case and the claim is finalized; these claims cannot be adjusted any longer. Claims marked as Third Party Recovery indicate that the Department received funds from a primary insurance carrier; these claims can be adjusted, but the recovery amount will remain with the claim for historical purposes, regardless of what is updated by the provider. All claims are priced in one (1) of four (4) ways when determining coordination of benefits: 1. Member Responsibility Add together the primary’s coinsurance, co-payment, and deductible. If no coinsurance, co-payment, and/or deductible are reported, then the payment is zero. Claims paid with this method: • Medicare Part A • Hospital Inpatient (Unless primary was not active the full length of the stay.) • QMB-Only",

July 1, 2025 Page 129 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.4 Submitting Third Party Liability Claims The claim must be submitted correctly to the responsible third party before it may be submitted to Medicaid. After receiving either a partial payment or a denial from an insurance company, submit the claim to Medicaid for payment consideration along with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) including the information for the claim and the explanation of the remark codes. Do not wait to submit claims to Medicaid if doing so would cause the claim to be denied for timely filing. See the Timely Filing Limit section for more information. A billing or timeliness error is not considered a valid denial for the purposes of satisfying the requirement to bill all other insurances. The following are examples of denials that are not accepted for paper, online, or electronic claims: • Claim lacks information needed for adjudication; • Prior Authorization required; • Patient cannot be identified as our insured; • Claim filed past filing time limit; and • Duplicate of a previously submitted claim. When submitting the claim to Medicaid, verify that the dates of service, units, detail charges, and total charges are the same on the primary insurance EOB and on the claim to Medicaid. If the other insurance carrier denied the claim, submit the claim to Gainwell Technologies (GWT) for processing. A copy of the other insurance company’s EOB (both detail about the claim and an explanation of the remark codes) must be attached to the claim to document the other insurance company’s denial. The denial must be validated before the claim can be processed by GWT. The following types of documentation are not acceptable as EOBs: • Screen prints of primary insurance system, or an internal system; • Word documents; • Eligibility inquiries; • Claim inquiries; or • Claim rejection notices. A paper EOB from the other insurer is included with paper claims, including the EOB claim resolution message from the other insurance and the explanation of any remark codes. Since there are hundreds of insurers, each with their own remark coding system, Idaho Medicaid cannot process a claim unless the EOB number and message is included with the paper claim. Fill in the other insurance paid amount in the appropriate field of the claim. If the insurance pays at zero, 0.00 must be recorded in the appropriate field or the claim will be denied. These claims must be submitted to Medicaid with the EOB attached. When some of the services were paid by the liable third-party and others denied, the claim must be split between the paid and the denied services on separate claim forms along with the EOB. If you receive notification or a claim rejection notice that your member has lost primary insurance coverage from the carrier please contact HMS at P.O. Box 94630, Seattle, WA 98124-6930, or by phone at 1 (800) 873-5875. A member’s primary insurance record must be verified as inactive before the claims processing system can be updated and claims can be paid.

July 1, 2025 Page 133 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.4.4 Split Claims Sometimes claims are billed to other insurance companies with more lines than will fit on the Medicaid paper claim form. To create a matching claim, the claim must be split. If the other insurance’s Explanation of Benefits (EOB) has more detail lines than will fit on the claim form, divide the claim into two or more separate claims. Submit the first lines on one claim form and the remaining lines on additional claim forms. Write Split Claim in Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form, or Field/Box 80 of the UB-04 claim form. Total each claim. Pro-rate the third-party payments to match the lines billed Attach a separate copy of the EOB to each split claim. When billing electronically, it is not necessary to split a claim unless the provider is submitting more than the maximum number of detail lines allowed on the claim. • Professional claims: Up to 50 details • Institutional claims: Up to 999 details Claims must also be split between paid and denied services. Note: ICD-10-CM codes S00 to T88.9 are injury diagnoses. For more on using diagnosis codes in this range see section, Injury Liability, before submitting your claim. This helps prevent an unnecessary claim denial.

July 1, 2025 Page 134 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5 Claims for Participants with Medicare Providers must enroll with the Idaho Medicaid Program separately from Medicare. When the participant is dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare must be billed first. Claims submitted to Medicare electronically crossover to Medicaid. Claims that fail to automatically cross over from Medicare must be submitted to Medicaid with a Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN) attached. The MRN must include the Medicare payment or non-payment reason code. If the MRN does not clearly identify that it is an MRN, write on the top right margin of the claim or the MRN, ”Medicare MRN” or ”Medicare HMO” , if applicable to help sort the claim. Medicare Excluded Services do not require a MRN to be considered by Medicaid. If the participant’s coverage is handled through a private insurance carrier that is not Medicare, then the provider must submit an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the primary insurance. When Medicare is the primary carrier for payment, the Idaho Medicaid authorization requirements do not apply. Medicare guidelines are followed. If Medicare denies the claim, Idaho Medicaid becomes the primary payer and Idaho Medicaid’s prior authorization, documentation, processing, and payment rules apply. Claims for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB; rate code 68) are eligible for reimbursement as described under the Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries section. See the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for information related to the different kinds of Medicare and Medicaid",

See the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for information related to the different kinds of Medicare and Medicaid coverage a participant may have. A participant’s Medicare Part A and Part B information is available by calling the Medicaid Automated Customer Services (MACS) line at 1 (866) 686-4272 and choosing the other insurance menu option. July 1, 2025 Page 135 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.1 Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries Participants enrolled only as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB; rate code 68) are not eligible for Medicaid benefits. Services denied or not covered by Medicare for QMB participants are denied when billed to Medicaid. Claims submitted with both Medicare covered and Medicare non-covered services on the same claim are denied. The provider must split bill both covered and non-covered services. The exception to this rule is Medicare excluded services or when the provider reports modifiers GY or GZ on a Medicare non-covered service for which they expect no payment from Idaho Medicaid. Excluded services are those that Medicare never pays for, vs. non-covered, which Medicare may pay in certain circumstances. These claims are only eligible for the Member Responsibility portion across all provider types. Member Responsibility is calculated by adding together the primary payers’ coinsurance, co- payment, and deductible. If no coinsurance, co-payment, and/or deductible are reported, then the Medicaid payment is zero. Claims filed secondary to Medicare and sent electronically by Medicare are called crossover claims. On the Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN) the payment of these charges appears on the first detail line of the paid claim on the Professional Crossover Claims page. Each claim form must be submitted with an MRN attached. All claims submitted online or on paper must match the MRN exactly.

July 1, 2025 Page 136 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.2 Medicare Advantage To ensure the claim is processed correctly, claim forms must be filled out completely. If the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) does not designate Medicare Advantage, specify which plan is indicated in box 9D or 11C on the CMS-1500. On the UB-04, indicate the plan in box 50. July 1, 2025 Page 137 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.3 Split Claims Claims will deny if submitted with both Medicare covered and Medicare non-covered services on the same claim. Providers must split bill these services. An exception to this rule is when modifier GY and/or GZ are reported for Medicare non-covered services. These services can be billed on the same claim with a Medicare covered service. Sometimes claims are billed to Medicare with more lines than will fit on the paper claim form. To create a matching paper claim, the claim must be split. When the Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN) has more detail lines than will fit on the claim form, split the claim. Submit two claims with the first lines on one claim form and the remaining lines on additional claim forms. Write Split Claim in Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form or in Field/Box 80 of the UB-04 claim form. Leave the fields for amount paid and balance due blank. Attach a separate copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to each split claim. Total each claim. When billing electronically, it is not necessary to split a claim unless submitting more than the maximum number of details allowed on one (1) claim. • Professional claims: Up to 50 details • Institutional claims: Up to 999 details (a) References: Split Claims (i) Idaho Medicaid Publications “Billing Tips for Medicare Crossover – Split Claims.” MedicAide Newsletter, October 2007. “Claims for Medicare Covered/Non-Covered Services.” MedicAide Newsletter, August 2012, https://www.idmedicaid.com/MedicAide%20Newsletters/August%202012%20MedicAide.pdf .

July 1, 2025 Page 139 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.5 Paper Claims for Dually Eligible Participants Information on dually eligible fee-for-service claims submitted on paper must match the information on the MRN exactly. The dates of service and dollar amounts must be the same as those on the MRN. File a separate claim for each claim on the MRN. Participants with both Medicare and private insurance must have an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from both carriers attached to the Medicaid claim form. When billing paper claims for dually eligible participants: • Use the participant’s MID number. • Use the Idaho Medicaid provider number. • Fill in fields required on standard Medicaid claims. • Sign and date all claims. • Attach the MRN to the claim and ensure that the MRN is clearly identified as Medicare, Medicare HMO, or Medicare Supplement on the claim form or MRN; include any explanations of the remark code(s). • Ensure all attachments are on 8 1/2\" x 11\" paper. When the participant is not Medicaid eligible for a certain date of service, do not enter those charges on the claim. Enter a note on the front of the claim explaining that this is why the MRN does not match the claim. July 1, 2025 Page 140 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.6 Crossover Errors Occasionally, a claim from Medicare does not automatically crossover to Gainwell Technologies (GWT). This occurs when the Medicare and Medicaid participant numbers on file do not match. If a claim does not appear on the Medicaid remittance advice (RA) within four weeks after Medicare payment, submit a claim to Medicaid for processing. Call GWT’s Provider Enrollment at 1 (866) 686-4272 to verify that all provider numbers are on file to allow for automatic crossover. Medicaid claims must be submitted within 6 months of the payment date of the Medicare EOB. July 1, 2025 Page 141 of 153 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions 7.5.7 Resubmitting Crossover Claims Claims for dually eligible in fee-for-service which are returned to the provider by Medicare for any reason must be resubmitted as a Medicaid claim. Attach the original claim and any other supporting documentation to a copy of the Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN). Include both your provider number and the participant’s Medicaid identification (MID) number. The claim dates of service, billed amounts and the MRN must match. Occasionally, Medicare combines or splits claims to expedite processing. When this happens, change the Medicaid claim form to match the MRN. The services Medicare processes as a single claim under one claim number must match exactly the service billed on the claim submitted to Medicaid, with the exception as noted in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook section for Emergency Department/Rooms and Observation. Lab services are usually paid at 100% of the approved amounts. The claim total differs from the total billed on the MRN if you do not bill these charges to Medicaid. Adding a notation on a claim (Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form) stating that the lab charges were paid reduces the chance of a claim being returned in error.

Claims are still subject to timely filing requirements. Include all documentation regarding the injury with the claim or on the electronic claim record, even if there are several claims for the same injury. Claims are reviewed separately and each stands on its own merit. All possible third party involvement must be investigated for injury liability. The participant should be contacted for information about the circumstances of the injury. If investigation reveals no third party liability or shows the claim is not accident related, submit the claim to Medicaid with information regarding attempts made to identify a third party or obtain accident information. The information must demonstrate that at least three attempts were made. Document the person(s) to whom the provider spoke, date and time of the contacts. In the event that the participant receives a payout directly from a third-party to cover their medical costs, the provider may bill the participant up to the amount of the direct payout. This would be reported on a claim as being received from the primary insurer. To prevent a claim from being denied for additional information, providers should submit letters of denial; maximums met, no liability, or other documentation, with the claim. Indicate in Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form, or Field/Box 80 of the UB-04 claim form the following information: • How the injury occurred; • If the injury is not accident related; • Where the injury occurred (home, someone else’s home, work, commercial property, auto, etc.); • Date the injury occurred; • Dates, times and names of person contacted for information, if applicable; and • Name and phone number of the attorney, if applicable.

The provider agrees to accept what Medicaid paid as payment in full. The provider is prohibited from submitting those same charges for reimbursement in the litigation. The provider cannot later refund Medicaid and accept a payment from litigation. Option Two: Pursue payment through litigation The provider forgoes payment from Medicaid. The provider collects payment from the participant up to a maximum of what they received through litigation. Regardless of the litigation’s outcome, the provider may not bill Medicaid or the Medicaid participant for those services.

    "text": "Idaho Medicaid Nursing Facility Special Rates OVERVIEW Nursing Facility Special Rates are an add-on rate to the per diem reimbursement to care for members whose care needs exceed what is typically covered in a nursing facility. Cares that exceed the per diem amount are ventilator and tracheostomy care or specialized durable medical equipment. Special Rates are approved on a case-by-case basis. RATE TYPES Ventilator and tracheostomy care are fixed add-on rates. These rates are updated on a yearly basis to account for changes in costs to supplies and nursing care. CURRENT RATES (Effective Current Year) - Ventilator Reimbursement Rate: $349.92 per day - Tracheostomy Reimbursement Rate: $206.99 per day QUALIFYING CONDITIONS Special rates apply when care needs exceed standard nursing facility coverage: 1. Ventilator care 2. Tracheostomy care 3. Specialized durable medical equipment (DME) APPROVAL PROCESS - Special Rates must be approved on a case-by-case basis - All Special Rate Forms should be faxed to: 877-314-8782 - For more information, contact: MedicalCareUnit@dhw.idaho.gov BILLING Special rates are added to the standard per diem rate for qualifying residents. The facility receives: - Base per diem rate (standard nursing facility rate) - Plus applicable special rate(s) for ventilator/tracheostomy care Example: If base rate is $200/day and resident requires ventilator care, total reimbursement = $200 + $349.92 = $549.92 per day IMPORTANT NOTES - Special rates require prior authorization - Rates are updated annually - Documentation of medical necessity is required - Contact Medical Care Unit for questions or clarifications",

    "text": "Understanding the Idaho Skilled Nursing Facility Medicaid rate sheet There are several data items present on the rate summary sheet sent each quarter to Idaho skilled nursing providers. Understanding each of these data items and their interrelationship with various facility operations is critical to adjusting practices to maximize reimbursement. The purpose of this paper is to explain each section of the rate summary page and identify certain items operators should be watching to ensure they are receiving appropriate reimbursement. For the purposes of this explanation, the rate sheet will be divided into six sections. These sections are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. The case mix tables, located in the upper ¼ of the summary page, The cost detail, located between the CMI table and Rate Calculations, The indirect cost column, located slightly below and left of the center of the page, The direct cost column, located slightly below and to the right of the center of the page, The exempt cost column, located to the right of the direct cost column, and The Summary of Rate Components, located in the lower right corner of the page. Please refer to the Rate Calculation Worksheet included at the end of this explanation. The six sections are described in detail below. SECTION 1: THE CASE MIX INDEX TABLE The case mix table on the Rate Calculation Worksheet looks like this: CMI Table Rate Period C/R Period Facility Wide: 1.1065 1.1582 Facility Medicaid: 1.1110 1.0872 State-Wide Avg.: 1.1638 1.1467 The Case Mix Index (CMI) is calculated based on the MDS’s that are regularly sent by facilities to the state repository. Idaho uses a 34-group RUG III model, nursing weights only. The weights by RUG category are listed on the last page. The state has a computer program which automatically converts the MDS 3.0 to the RUG III grouper system. Every quarter, each facility receives a report from Myers and Stauffer that lists all patients with MDS’s in the state repository, along with each patient’s payor status, RUG category, and case mix score. It is imperative that the facility review this information and Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 1 of 9 send corrections to the state as soon as possible. You cannot change the RUG category on this page, but you can change whether a certain patient was in the facility as of the picture date (the last day of the previous quarter) and their payor status. If a patient’s payor status changed from Medicare to Medicaid between the time the MDS was submitted and the end of the picture date (remember you do not need to complete an MDS when taking a patient off Medicare), note on the page the new payor source and the effective date. If a patient is listed on the page and he or she was discharged or expired between the time the MDS was submitted and the picture date and the discharge tracking form has not been submitted to the state repository yet, state that the patient was discharged and list the date of discharge on the patient list. You cannot add patients to the list who were admitted before the picture date but whose MDS’s were not submitted in time to appear on the patient list from Myers and Stauffer. For this reason, you should submit MDS’s frequently, and especially just prior to the picture date, to get the most accurate picture of your current patient population. Although it is required for MDS’s to be submitted within 30 days after closing and locking, most facilities submit MDS’s on a weekly basis. Not only does this ensure the most up to date information is in the state repository, it reduces potential problems of computer malfunctions or other issues preventing MDS transmission within the allowable time frames. Further, after you submit MDS’s to the state, you receive a Validation Report. The MDS submitter should review this document to be sure all MDS’s were received and processed correctly and that none were rejected. It is much better to do this with smaller reports on a weekly basis rather than a very large report if you submit only once per month. The CMI for the Cost Report (C/R) period is an aggregation of the MDS’s submitted to the state repository during your particular facility’s cost report period. The table includes the average CMI for all patients in your facility during the cost report period, all Medicaid patients in your facility during the cost report period, and the state-wide average case mix score for all patients in Idaho skilled nursing facilities during your facility’s cost report period. The CMI for the Rate Period lists the average case mix index for your facility for the quarter used to determine your rate. Average CMI scores are",

    "text": "for the Cost Report (C/R) period is an aggregation of the MDS’s submitted to the state repository during your particular facility’s cost report period. The table includes the average CMI for all patients in your facility during the cost report period, all Medicaid patients in your facility during the cost report period, and the state-wide average case mix score for all patients in Idaho skilled nursing facilities during your facility’s cost report period. The CMI for the Rate Period lists the average case mix index for your facility for the quarter used to determine your rate. Average CMI scores are listed for all patients in your facility for the Rate Period, plus your facility’s Medicaid patients only, plus the state wide average CMI for the rate period. The “Rate Period” is always a three month lag, so the MDS’s submitted to the state from January 1 through March 31 impacts your reimbursement rates effective July 1 of that year. MDS’s submitted from April 1 through June 30 impact your rates effective October 1, and so on. Out of the six CMI figures listed on the table, only three are used for the current rate calculation quarter: the Facility Wide CMI for the Cost Report Period; the State-Wide Average for the Cost Report Period, and the Facility Medicaid for the Rate Period. The usage of these CMI’s is described below under Section 4: Direct Cost Component. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 2 of 9 Analyzing/Interpretation/Improving the CMI Data First, look at your baseline. This is your facility CMI scores for the entire facility for the cost report period. Compare this average to the state average. Three situations are possible: Your average Facility-Wide CMI is higher than the state average. This normally means you have a higher Medicare population, and/or you are taking care of an overall higher acuity population than most Idaho skilled nursing facilities. Your facility staff probably does a good job of documenting mood and behaviors, ADLs, restorative care, and other factors that place more patients in higher acuity RUG categories. This also means your facility will have a higher direct care cap, because your facility-specific direct care cap is calculated by dividing the facility-wide case mix index for the cost report period by the state-wide average CMI for the cost report period and multiplying the result by the Per Diem Limit for direct care (explained in more detail under Section 4 below). Your average Facility-Wide CMI is lower than the state average. You may just be treating lighter care patients overall, but it could also be that your staff aren’t documenting items that positively impact your case mix index. See below for suggestions on improving your case mix index. Your average Facility-Wide CMI is almost the same as the state average. Your facility is neither better nor worse than other Idaho skilled facilities in terms of acuity scores, and you are very close to the average for Medicare census and acuity. What to do now? Suppose you want to review your acuity scores to make sure they are accurate, and that your Medicaid rates are based on your current acuity. First, compare the CMI for the rate period with the CMI for the cost report period for all three indicators. For example, if your facility wide CMI scores for the most recent rate period are higher than the cost report period, you are either taking credit for accurate assessments of ADL assistance provided and other factors positively impacting your CMI, or you are simply taking care of an overall higher acuity patient population. On the example CMI table on Page 1, you’ll see that the facility-wide CMI for the rate period is lower than the cost report period. While the facility-wide CMI for the rate period is not used for any part of the rate setting process, it does give you an indication of a trend in your overall acuity. If you feel the need to review the MDS’s of patients to make sure those factors impacting the acuity score are accurate, your time would be best spent following these guidelines: 1. Identify all Medicaid patients with acuity scores at or below your facility average CMI. Especially focus on the PA1 patients with an acuity score of 0.49.

Begin your chart audit of each patient identified above. Questions to answer include: a. b. c. d. e. How frequently is restorative care provided? It must be provided 6 days per week, two activities per day for 15 minutes per activity. If you are only providing restorative nursing care five days per week, it does not count as a restorative program for MDS purposes. Are restorative minutes documented accurately? Again, it needs to be 15 minutes per day per activity. Further, the restorative program must be overseen by a licensed nurse, and the restorative nursing assistants must have appropriate training. Is the ADL portion of the care plan appropriate, and does it list interventions that should be done but aren’t being done? Are there interventions that should be listed that aren’t included in the care plan? Are the goals measurable, and are they reviewed periodically? Are side rails listed as a mobility device instead of a restraint? If so, is restorative care being provided to make sure the patient is actually using the side rail as a bed mobility device or is the side rail actually a restraint? If the MDS is coded as a 3, 4, or 8 under Bed Mobility, there is a question of whether side rails are appropriately listed as bed mobility devices, and they will probably be deemed restraints by surveyors. Is the ADL coding accurate? Does it match the aide flow sheets? You should also talk directly with the caregivers on all shifts to be sure the coding is accurate. Remember that column B on Section G1 of the MDS says to code for “Most support provided over all shifts during last 7 days” and that the most support needed by the patient is probably not at 10 am when the restorative aides or therapists are right there, but at 7 am on Sunday morning when the aides provide a 2+ physical assist for bed mobility or transfer. Look especially closely at copy cat charting, where the aides simply put the previous day’s or shift’s code in the current shift’s flow sheet. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 4 of 9 f. Have any behaviors occurred over the past several weeks, and have they been appropriately documented in the nurse’s notes and behavior sheets, and were those observations transferred over to the MDS? g. Is there anything out of the ordinary in the nurse’s notes, social services notes, therapy notes, or the physician progress notes? For example, there may be something noted in one disciplines’ notes that wasn’t corroborated in other notes which would impact the acuity score. h. Can the patient benefit from a Part B therapy program? If that therapy is provided during the assessment window, regardless of how it was paid, it counts as therapy on the MDS and results in a higher RUG score. i. Are there skin issues that weren’t accurately coded on the MDS? Some people do not like to code stage 1 pressure ulcers because they think it results in a survey flag. While this is partially correct, if you are treating a skin issue as a pressure ulcer, it needs to be listed as a pressure ulcer on the MDS. Two or more sites at any stage, or one at stage 3 or 4 result in a RUG category of SS. 6. Personally examine the patient. See for yourself how much independence he or she has, and how much assistance is provided, in transferring, bed mobility, eating, and toilet use. Using all of the above information, determine if the MDS accurately depicts the patient’s condition. You should also determine if that patient is a candidate for Part B therapy or for initiation, modification, or termination of a restorative program. If you find the MDS is incorrect, follow the correction policy guidelines set by CMS. But also remember that several significant changes to your facility’s MDS’s may trigger increased scrutiny from surveyors, who may question why there was a breakdown in facility systems and processes that would allow inaccurate assessments to be filed with the state. Finally, some providers may wish to increase their CMI by providing more therapy services that they usually provide during an assessment window.",

Finally, some providers may wish to increase their CMI by providing more therapy services that they usually provide during an assessment window. While this practice will increase the CMI for that rate period, these higher case mix numbers will be averaged into the overall facility CMI when the cost report is filed. Future quarterly CMI adjustments will then be divided by the artificially higher base CMI and potentially reduce rates in future periods. This “double edged sword” reveals a simultaneous benefit and limitation of the SNF reimbursement system: facilities with gradual changes in CMI, census, and costs under the cap can do very well under this payment methodology. Facilities with large variations in CMI, census, and costs will have quarters and years that Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 5 of 9 are extremely profitable, and other quarters and years in which they will experience financial hardship. SECTION 2: COST DETAIL AND INFLATION ADJUSTMENT In the upper one third of the Rate Calculation Worksheet is a section labeled “Inflated Cost Summary.” The column under “Cost Detail” contains figures derived from your cost report. If your rate is a finalized rate based on an audited cost report, these totals can be traced directly from the “Schedule of Adjusted Costs” pages of your audit report. If your rate is an interim rate based on reported costs, in order to trace these amounts, you will need to request information from Myers and Stauffer. Myers and Stauffer uses your as-filed cost report and separates cost centers between the direct, indirect, property, and exempt cost centers. The cost report information included here is from the cost report period listed in the upper part of the Rate Calculation Worksheet. The derivation of the costs on the summary page is detailed in the subsequent pages of the rate sheet calculations. You, or your cost accountant, should be able to track costs listed on the cost report to the rate sheet. The Inflation Adjustment is no longer used, as it was removed in 2011 Legislature. Rates are now based strictly on historical costs per patient day. The third column in this section is entitled, “CMI Adjust for Food and Ancillaries or Indirect Ancillary Gross-Up.” This column performs two functions. First, food and the direct portion of ancillaries are included in direct care rate calculation, but are not case mix adjusted. Because all costs in the “Direct Cost” column of page one of the rate calculation worksheet are case mix adjusted, that case mix adjustment is reversed here to have a net impact of zero. Therefore, the costs associated with food and direct ancillary expenses are “reverse case mix adjusted” for lack of a better term, so that the entire direct care cost total can be case mix adjusted. Second, this column is also used to gross up ancillary costs. Ancillary costs included in the first column are the costs attributed solely to Medicaid services. Therefore, the Medicaid portion of ancillaries are grossed up by taking Medicaid ancillary cost, dividing by Medicaid days, times total patient days. This is necessary because on page 1 of the Rate Calculation Worksheet, total costs are divided by total days to calculate a per diem. Therefore, ancillary costs associated with just the Medicaid portion should be grossed up to reflect the total cost. The final column in this section is the sum of the previous three columns, and the totals by line item are then carried below to the columns in the lower one half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet page. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 6 of 9 SECTION 3: INDIRECT COST COMPONENT The lower half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the final rate calculation. The first column of numbers in this section presents the Indirect Cost component of your rate. Indirect costs include primarily overhead cost areas such as administration, housekeeping, dietary costs (except raw food), activities, and so on. The Indirect Cost Component is calculated according to the process outlined below: 1. The total indirect costs are divided by the total patient days in the cost report period to arrive at the indirect cost per patient day. 2. The cap for the current rate period is listed. It is the amount equal to 117% of the",

The total indirect costs are divided by the total patient days in the cost report period to arrive at the indirect cost per patient day. 2. The cap for the current rate period is listed. It is the amount equal to 117% of the median rate for indirect costs for all Idaho SNFs and is recalculated annually. 3. The facility indirect rate is the lesser of the inflated costs or the cap, so if the facility is below the indirect cap, it only the per diem costs per patient day. If it is over the cap, it will only receive the cap as its indirect cost component of its final rate. SECTION 4: DIRECT COST COMPONENT The second column of numbers in the lower half of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the derivation of your facility’s Direct Cost Component of your Medicaid rate. Direct costs include nursing and social service salaries and benefits, nursing supplies, Medicaid-related ancillaries, and raw food. The Direct Cost Component is calculated as follows: 1. 2. The total direct costs from the upper section of the Rate Calculation Worksheet are listed on the first line this column, and this total is divided by the total patient days for the cost report period to arrive at the direct cost per patient day. The state cap on Direct Costs is shown as the Per Diem Limit. This cap is an overall state cap, and the cap is adjusted for each facility based on that facility’s overall acuity for the cost report period compared to the state average acuity. The facility-specific cap is calculated by dividing the facility- wide average CMI for the cost report period by the state average CMI for the cost report period and multiplying the result by the state cap. Using the CMI table on page 1, the facility-wide CMI for the cost report period is 1.1582, and the state average CMI for the same period was 1.1467. The formula and resulting facility-specific cap is shown below:Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 7 of 9 3. Facility-wide CMI = 1.1582 = 1.0100 State Avg CMI 1.1467 Therefore, because the facility has an overall acuity slightly higher than the state average (exactly 1 percent higher than the state average), it makes sense that it would have a higher cap. The lower of the inflated cost per patient day (described in #1 of this section) or the facility-specific cap on direct costs is then adjusted to reflect the assumed ratio of costs associated with Medicaid patients compared to all other patients (private, Medicare, VA, insurance, etc.) in the facility. This adjustment divides the Facility Medicaid CMI for the Rate Period by the Facility Wide CMI for the cost report period. Using the case mix table on page 1, the resulting calculation is: Medicaid avg CMI = 1.1110 = 0.9592 Facility-wide CMI 1.1582 The direct cost component, and the customary charge calculation (below) are the only parts of the Medicaid rate that changes throughout the year. The change to the direct portion of the rate is based solely on acuity scores for Medicaid patients for the period ending 90 days prior to the current rate period (MDS’s submitted between January 1 and March 31 will impact direct care rates effective July 1-September 30). SECTION 5: EXEMPT COSTS AND NATCEP Exempt costs include property taxes, property insurance, utilities, and costs associated with the Nurse Aide Training and Certification Evaluation Program (NATCEP). For hospital-based providers, exempt costs also include property costs. These are pass- through costs not subject to any limitation. SECTION 6: SUMMARY OF RATE COMPONENTS The lower right corner of the Rate Calculation Worksheet contains the summary of all of the individual components of your facility’s Medicaid rate. It also includes the property component, which is defined in detail in Idaho rule. In general, the property rate for free- standing nursing facilities is based on the Marshall-Swift Valuation Index, and the age of all nursing facilities in Idaho have been frozen at their age in 1991 for facilities constructed on or before that date. Explanation of the Idaho Medicaid SNF Reimbursement System Updated 10 August 2016 Page 8 of 9 Look at your own Medicaid rate sheet to see how these components add up. Remember there is also an additional 2.7 percent reduction because Idaho’s budget shortfalls during 2009-2011.

Remember there is also an additional 2.7 percent reduction because Idaho’s budget shortfalls during 2009-2011. This amount was replaced with a provider tax so the facilities will get this amount returned to them through a different program. Finally, your Medicaid rate is limited to the lesser of the sum of rate components or the customary charge. The customary charge is calculated as your semi-private room rate plus the Medicaid charges of reimbursable ancillaries. The ancillary portion is inflated to the rate period using the same method for inflating costs, and is also case mix adjusted by dividing facility Medicaid CMI for the rate period by facility Medicaid CMI for the cost report period. The result of the Medicaid ancillary portion is divided by Medicaid days and is added to your semi-private room rate. For this reason, it is imperative that you charge out all appropriate ancillary services and supplies to all patients, including those whose primary payor is the Medicaid program.

Sections of the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook applicable in specific situations are listed throughout the handbook for provider convenience. Additional handbook sections which always apply to this provider type include the following: • General Billing Instructions; • General Information and Requirements for Providers; and • Glossary. Handbooks can only be used properly in context. Providers must be familiar with the handbooks that affect them and their services. The numbering in handbooks is also important to make note of as subsections rely on the content of the sections above them. Example Section 1.2.3.a The Answer requires the reader to have also read Section 1, Section 1.2 and Section 1.2.3 to be able to properly apply Section 1.2.3.a. References are included throughout the handbook for provider and staff convenience. Not all applicable references have been incorporated into the handbook. Not all references provided are equal in weight. • Case Law: Includes references to court cases that established interpretations of law that states and providers would be required to follow. • CMS Guidance: These references reflect various Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid services. • Federal Regulations: These references are regulations from the federal level that affected policy development. Usually these include the Code of Federal Regulations, the Social Security Act and other statutes. They are required to be followed. • Idaho Medicaid Publications: These are communications from Idaho Medicaid to providers that were required to be followed when published. These are included in the handbook for historical reference. The provider handbook supersedes other communications unless the documents are listed in the Department’s Rules, Statutes, and Policies webpage under policies in Medicaid’s department library. • Idaho State Plan: The State Plan is the agreement between the State of Idaho and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on how the State will administer its medical assistance program. • Professional Organizations: These references reflect various publications of professional organizations that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy. Providers may or may not be required to follow these references, depending on the individual reference and its application to a provider’s licensure and scope of practice. • State Regulations: These references are regulations from the state level that affected policy development. They usually include statute and IDAPA. They are required to be followed. • Scholarly Work: These references are publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their policy.

Provider Qualifications Long-term care service providers (i.e. nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities) in any state are eligible to participate in the Idaho Medicaid Program. They must be licensed and certified in the state where the services are performed and enroll as an Idaho Medicaid provider prior to submitting claims for services. Skilled nursing facilities must also be enrolled with Medicare. Providers must follow the provider handbook and all applicable state, and federal, rules and regulations. See General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information on enrolling as an Idaho Medicaid provider. November 18, 2022 Page 4 of 26 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Long-Term Care Facility 3. Eligible Participants Participants with Medicaid Enhanced Plans are eligible to receive services in a Long-Term Care Facility (i.e., nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities). When billing for participants enrolled in other benefit plans, refer to General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for coverage. Providers must check participant eligibility prior to delivery of the service by calling Idaho Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) at 1 (866) 686-4272; or through the Trading Partner Account on Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website. 3.1.

Advance Directives Long-Term Care providers must explain to each participant their right to make decisions regarding their medical care, which includes the right to accept or refuse treatment. Long- Term Care providers will inform the participant of their right to formulate advance directives, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for health care at the time of the participant’s admission as a resident. As of January 1, 2018, Idaho Medicaid will reimburse for advanced care planning under CPT® 99497 if provided for a minimum of 30 minutes, and CPT® 99498 for each additional 30 minutes. ACP may include Health Care Proxy, Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, Living Will, or Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. The service is voluntary and is only reimbursable if the participant elects to receive the counseling. It may be rendered by any physician or non-physician practitioner in any location. It may also be rendered by other staff provided they meet the minimum direct supervision requirements. ACP is billable separately from a global surgical period, an annual wellness visit or E&M.

November 18, 2022 Page 11 of 26 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Long-Term Care Facility 7. Covered Services and Limitations: Intermediate Care Facility/Individual with Intellectual Disabilities Intermediate Care Facility/Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) services include nursing services, room and board services, therapies, over-the-counter medications, social services, activities, and such other services required as a condition of facility certification. The per diem rate includes all medically necessary ICF/IID services including nursing services, room and board services, therapy services (occupational, physical, and speech), over-the- counter medications, social services, activities, and such other services required as a condition of facility certification. The date of admission counts as the first day of care for reimbursement. The Department only reimburses for the date of the participant’s discharge if the discharge occurs after 3:00 p.m. and the participant is not discharged to a related provider. If a Medicaid participant dies in an ICF/IID, the date of death is reimbursed as a day of care regardless of the time of occurrence. If admission and discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. Legend drugs, physician services, and certain other costs are paid directly by the Department and separately from other ICF/IID payments. Facilities may request Special Rates for participants who require long-term care needs that exceed the scope of the services covered in the per diem. November 18, 2022 Page 12 of 26 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Long-Term Care Facility 7.1. ICF/IID: Leave of Absence (LOA) A leave of absence (LOA) occurs when a participant goes on a temporary leave of absence from the facility, such as to the hospital or home. A day may not be billed when a participant is on a non-covered leave of absence to home, in the hospital, or is not otherwise incurring a billable Medicaid day. Participants of ICF/IIDs are allowed up to 36 LOA days to go home per calendar year so long as the days are part of a written treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. Prior authorization from Medicaid must be obtained for any home visits exceeding 14 consecutive days. To request prior authorization, complete the ICF/IID Special Rate Leave of Absence Form and e-mail it to Michelle Mittelstedt at Michelle.Mittelstedt@dhw.idaho.gov. Payment for reserve bed days is 100 percent of the facility rate for ICF/IID participants. 7.1.1.

November 18, 2022 Page 14 of 26 Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Long-Term Care Facility 9. Reimbursement Idaho Medicaid reimburses claims on a per diem rate at the lower of the billed amount or Medicaid allowed amount; therefore, nursing facilities and ICF/IID facilities should always bill their usual and customary charges, rather than the Medicaid allowed per diem. A separate rate is assigned to each facility. When there are retrospective rate increases or decreases, the adjusted rates are added to the system and DHW initiates mass adjustments to previously paid claims for that facility for the time period that the rates have been adjusted. If the original claim was billed at the Medicaid allowed amount and the rate is increased retrospectively, the adjusted claim will pay at the original billed amount. The provider will not receive additional reimbursement. See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook regarding Medicaid policy on billing all other third party resources before submitting claims to Medicaid. Participants cannot be billed for any non-reimbursed amount. Providers may only bill non- covered services to the participant if the provider meets the requirements in the Participant Financial Responsibility section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.

Special Rates Special rates may be requested to pay for care given to participants who have Long-Term Care needs beyond the normal scope of facility services. The payments for such specialized care will be in addition to any payments made to the facility. Special rates are requested by submitting the form specific to the facility type found below. Special Rate Request Forms Facility Type Webpage Form ICF/IID Medicaid Providers ICF/IID Special Rate Request Form Nursing Facility Special Rates Idaho Special Rate Request Form – Skilled Nursing Facility Medicaid will notify the facility if its special rate request is approved or denied. If a participant is approved for special rate pricing, an approval letter will be sent out to the provider. The provider must submit claims with Revenue Code 0101 for approved long-term care special rate pricing. 9.2.1.

Medicare Crossovers Nursing facility and ICF/IID services that have been paid by Medicare Part A do not automatically cross over to Medicaid. These claims must be submitted manually. Services that have been paid by Medicare Part B will cross over to Medicaid for payment when there is a deductible or coinsurance amount due for those services. Examples of Medicare Part B covered claims are physical therapy, certain medical supplies, and liquid nutrition when it is one hundred percent of the participant’s nutritional intake. Always submit the total charges billed to Medicare, not just the allowed amount. Medicaid’s payment for Part B cross over services will be calculated according to the “Lesser Of” methodology.
