PASRR (Preadmission Screening and Resident Review) - Idaho Medicaid

Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) is federally mandated for all members, regardless of payment source, admitting to a Medicaid nursing facility. The PASRR screens for serious mental illness (SMI) and intellectual/developmental disability or related condition (ID/RC). The goal of PASRR is to prevent the warehousing of individuals with SMI and/or ID/RC in nursing facilities by ensuring nursing facility placement is appropriate. If nursing facility placement is appropriate, and the individual would benefit, specialized services or specialized rehabilitative services are offered and provided.

PASRR Level I (87) screenings are completed in the order they are received, Monday through Friday between 8am and 5pm.

For PASRR questions related to specific individuals please contact the region Bureau of Long Term Care office.
