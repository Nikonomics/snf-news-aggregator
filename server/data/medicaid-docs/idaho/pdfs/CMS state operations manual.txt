Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
General Information and Requirements for Providers
The General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook,
is applicable to all provider types, and must be followed except where otherwise stated for a
specific provider type. Should the handbook ever appear to contradict relevant provisions of
Idaho or federal regulations, the regulations prevail. Any paper or digital copy of these
documents is considered out of date except the version appearing on Gainwell Technologies’
Idaho Medicaid website.
Providers must follow their provider type or service specific handbook as located in the
Provider Guidelines. Handbooks in addition to this one which always apply to providers
include:
• General Billing Instructions; and
• Glossary.
Handbooks can only be used properly in context. Providers must be familiar with the
handbooks that affect them and their services. The numbering in handbooks is also important
to make note of as subsections rely on the content of the sections above them.
Example
Section 1.2.3(a) The Answer requires the reader to have also read Section 1,
Section 1.2 and Section 1.2.3 to be able to properly apply Section 1.2.3(a).
References are included throughout the handbook for provider and staff convenience. Not all
applicable references have been incorporated into the handbook. Not all references provided
are equal in weight.
• Case Law: Includes references to court cases that established interpretations of law
that states and providers would be required to follow.
• CMS Guidance: These references reflect various Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their
policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid
services.
• Federal Regulations: These references are regulations from the federal level that
affected policy development. Usually these include the Code of Federal Regulations,
the Social Security Act and other statutes. They are required to be followed.
• Idaho Medicaid Publications: These are communications from Idaho Medicaid to
providers that were required to be followed when published. These are included in the
handbook for historical reference. The provider handbook supersedes other
communications unless the documents are listed in the Policies, Procedures, and
Waivers webpage under policies in Medicaid Policies library.
• Idaho State Plan: The State Plan is the agreement between the State of Idaho and the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on how the State will administer its medical
assistance program.
• Professional Organizations: These references reflect various publications of
professional organizations that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their
policy. Providers may or may not be required to follow these references, depending on
the individual reference and its application to a provider’s licensure and scope of
practice.
• Scholarly Work: These references are publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the
formulation of their policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed
for Idaho Medicaid services.
July 1, 2025 Page 1 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
• State Regulations: These references are regulations from the state level that affected
policy development. They usually include statute and IDAPA. They are required to be
followed.
Some citations may not be available on the internet. Copies of the documents may be
requested with a public records request. Guidance for public records requests is available on
the Department’s website.

services under Medicaid;
• To abide by their provider agreement;
• To review and abide by the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook;
• To review and abide by periodic provider Information Releases and other program
notifications issued by Medicaid such as the MedicAide Newsletter;
• To make records available to Medicaid upon request per the Documentation
subsection;
• To abide by Provider Enrollment requirements including, but not limited to:
o Being licensed, certified, or registered with the appropriate state authority and
to provide items and services in accordance with professionally recognized
standards;
o Complying with the disclosure of Ownership and Controlling Interests;
o Keeping Medicaid and Gainwell Technologies advised of the provider’s current
address and telephone number per the Maintenance of Information subsection;
• To sign every claim form submitted for payment or complete a signature-on-file form
(including electronic signatures). See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid
Provider Handbook for more information;
• To acknowledge when Medicaid is a secondary payer and agree to seek payment from
other sources. See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook
for more information about third party liability;
• To accept Medicaid payment for any item or service as payment in full and to make no
additional charge to participants or other parties for the difference. See the Participant
Financial Responsibility section for more information;
• To not bill a Medicaid participant unless the item or service is non-covered or excluded
by Medicaid, and the provider complies with the Participant Financial Responsibility
section. See Non-Covered and Excluded Services, which includes a list of excluded
services, for more information; and
• To assure Medicaid participants are not billed for “no-show” or missed appointments
nor can they enter into an agreement to be responsible for any resulting fees.
All correspondence sent to the provider’s mailing address on file with the State’s fiscal agent
shall be deemed to be received by the Provider. Department correspondence is not forwarded
July 1, 2025 Page 3 of 162

by a change of address with the U.S. Postal Service. All mail and checks are returned to
Gainwell Technologies.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
1.1. Employees and Contractors
Providers are responsible for the recruiting, hiring, firing, training, supervision, scheduling,
and payroll for their employees, subcontractors, or agents. The Provider shall maintain
general liability insurance coverage, worker’s compensation, and unemployment insurance,
and shall pay all FICA taxes and state and federal tax withholding for its employees. The
Provider agrees to bill only for service providers who have the qualifications required for the
type of service being delivered.
Furthermore, providers assume sole responsibility for the actions of their employees and
contractors acting on the provider’s behalf. This includes the accuracy of claims submitted as
specified in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement. The provider shall immediately repay the
Department for any items or services determined to be improperly provided, documented, or
claimed. In cases of suspected fraud, the Department may refer individual employees to the
Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for further investigation and possible prosecution. Providers may
also contact local law enforcement or take independent civil action against employees to
recover losses caused by the employee.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
1.2. Documentation
All providers are required to generate records at the time the service is delivered and to
maintain documentation to fully document the extent of services submitted for Medicaid
reimbursement. Services which have not been sufficiently documented are not reimbursable.
The person delivering the services and any supervising providers must ensure all
documentation is legible, complete, dated, time-stamped, and includes a written or electronic
dated signature to attest that the records are a true and accurate account of the services
delivered.
1.2.1. Additional Documentation
Additional documentation requirements may vary by provider or service type and are listed
in the appropriate sections of the provider type and specialty specific Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbooks. Providers should consult the applicable handbooks on the Medicaid Provider Portal
prior to delivering or billing for services.
1.2.2. Amendments or Corrections
Any records requiring amendment or corrections must be clearly and permanently identified
and leave the original contents of the document legible. Amendments and corrections are
intended to provide clarification and cannot be used to add new services for billing or
retroactively establish medical necessity. Amendments and corrections separately require the
author to be clearly identified with their credentials, a signature and the date of the changes.
1.2.3. Artificial Intelligence
Documentation generated by artificial intelligence is not acceptable.
1.2.4. Electronic Transcription
Documentation is acceptable when generated by software transcribing verbal notes to text.
Providers are responsible for the accuracy of the transcription.
1.2.5. Signatures
Handwritten or electronic signatures (including those captured by Electronic Visit Verification
software certified by the Department) are acceptable. All signatures must be dated. Electronic
signatures must meet the requirements in the Electronic Signatures subsection. For
handwritten signatures, stamped and typed signatures are only allowed for providers with
proof of a physical disability that prevents their signing.
Records should be signed shortly after the service is provided with time allowed for
transcription by a scribe. Signatures cannot be added to documents beyond that time frame,
and scribes do not need to sign documents. Documentation signed by multiple providers is
allowed, when one provider is supervising another if the rendering provider is clearly
identified.
If the Department determines a handwritten signature is illegible, a provider may submit a
signature log or attestation with requested records to support the identity of the signer. A
signature log must include a typed list of provider names, titles and credentials followed by
the corresponding handwritten signature. Signature attestations must be signed and dated
by the author of the illegible signature. Attestations must include a statement of the
document’s validity, the name and credentials of the author, the date of service being attested
to and the participant’s name and Medicaid Identification Number (MID). Attestations can also
be used as documentation for missing signatures.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
a) Electronic Signatures
Idaho Medicaid will accept dated electronic signatures for provider orders and records to meet
the requirements for documentation. The individual whose name is on the electronic signature
and the provider bear the responsibility for authenticity. Each provider must develop written
policies and procedures to assure complete, accurate, and authenticated records and at a
minimum include:
• Security provisions to protect against the use of an electronic signature by anyone
other than the person to which the electronic signature belongs;
• How the privacy and integrity of the record is protected;
• A list of which records will be maintained and signed electronically;
• How an e-signature code is assigned;
• How passwords are assigned and the frequency for which they are changed in provider
software;
• Clarification on whether a digital signature, a digitized signature, or an electronic
signature is being used, and the details of the signing process involved; and
• Access standards to the records for participants, the Department and others who are
authorized by law.
The following are not considered acceptable electronic signatures and may not be accepted
by Idaho Medicaid: (a) created by, (b) received by/for, (c) generated by/for, (d)
administratively signed by, (e) dictated but not signed, (f) electronically signed to expedite
delivery, or (g) proxy signature (signed via approval letter or statement).
Providers are encouraged to review and apply HIPAA guidance on the U.S. Health & Human
Services site: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html. As required by
HIPAA-covered entities, the provider must ensure the software program used is set up so that
the signer cannot deny having signed the document in the future, the signer’s identity is
guaranteed at the time the signature was generated, and the document has not been altered
since it was signed. Providers using Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) software to verify
service delivery meet these requirements when their EVV software is certified by the
Department or its contractor.
1.2.6. Retention of Records
Providers are required to retain records of documented services submitted for Medicaid
reimbursement for at least five (5) years from the date of service. Documentation must be
made available immediately upon request from the Department, Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), or any Department or CMS contractor acting in their official capacity.
Documentation must be sufficient to substantiate the amount, duration, scope, and medical
necessity of billed services. Documentation to support claims for services includes, but is not
limited to, medical records, treatment plans, medical necessity justification, assessments,
appointment sheets, patient accounts, financial records, or other records regardless of its
form or media. Medicaid may recoup the payment and apply a penalty if proper documentation
cannot be produced by the provider.
Documentation created after a Department records request is made will not be accepted.
Intentional deception or misrepresentation made with the knowledge that the deception could
result in an unauthorized benefit constitutes fraud, and offending individuals will be referred
for prosecution.

1.3. Ordering, Referring and Prescribing Providers
As a condition of payment, provider’s claims designated in the Provider Types and Specialties,
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook requires inclusion of an enrolled ordering, referring or
prescribing (ORP) provider’s name and NPI. If the claims are submitted without an enrolled
provider’s name and NPI, they will deny. Claims that come directly from Medicare to Idaho
Medicaid will not require an enrolled ORP, but if the provider submits a manual claim it will
deny without one.
The definition for ordering, prescribing, and referring includes, but is not limited to:
prescribing drugs or other covered items, sending a participants specimens to a laboratory
for testing, ordering imaging/diagnostic services or durable medical equipment, prosthetics,
orthotics or supplies for a participant, referring a participant to another provider or certifying
a participants need for covered items or services.
Based on the State of Idaho’s medical licensing structure and statutes, the following individual
provider types may order, refer, or prescribe healthcare services or supplies for participants
of the Idaho Medicaid program. These services or supplies must be requested in accordance
with the provider’s scope of practice and their licensure, which includes any certifications or
credentials they possess. Eligible healthcare professionals are:
• Dentists;
• Licensed midwives;
• Nurse practitioners;
• Optometrists;
• Pharmacists;
• Physicians including residents, licensed bridge year physicians and licensed
international medical graduates;
• Physician assistants;
• Podiatrists; and
• Psychologists (except school-based psychologists, who are exempt).
ORP providers must:
• Enroll with Idaho Medicaid as a billing provider, a non-billing ORP, or a crossover
provider;
• Complete enrollment application;
• Complete Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement; and
• Retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of
medical necessity for the services, equipment or supplies.
Billing providers must:
• Ensure all ORP providers are enrolled with Idaho Medicaid;
• Obtain the name and the NPI of the ORP provider and include it on claims; and
• Retain all documentation to support services billed
Interns and students (except first-year physician residents) are not eligible to enroll as ORP
providers. The teaching, admitting or supervising eligible healthcare professional, however,
can review their documentation and perform the order or referral on their behalf.

1.4.2. Availability to Provide Services
An agency may allow an employee to provide care or services on a provisional basis when
certain criteria are met. The individual must complete and have notarized the Background
Check Unit’s application. The agency must review the application for disqualifying incidents.
Individuals with a disqualifying incident cannot provide services. Individuals failing to disclose
information receive an unconditional denial and may be prosecuted. Agencies that prompt the
individual to refrain from fully disclosing their history are subject to penalties including up to,
but not limited to, recoupment, disenrollment from the Idaho Medicaid program, or
prosecution. Individuals seeking licensure or certification are not eligible to provide services
until a background check clearance is received.
When the application contains no disqualifying incidents, the agency must decide based on
the information provided if the individual is safe to provide services to participants. Services
may be provided when there are no disqualifying incidents and the agency determines the
individual is safe to provide services. Fingerprints must be submitted within twenty-one (21)
days of application submission and the results of the background check must be reviewed by
the agency within fourteen (14) days of a determination. Failure to do either or withdrawal of
the application makes the individual no longer eligible to provide services. The Department
may allow an extension for fingerprint submission at its discretion.
Individuals without a clearance are only eligible to provide services to an agency for twenty-
one (21) days in a rolling year. They cannot submit subsequent applications within that year
to continue to work beyond the twenty-one (21) day period. If fingerprints are not received
within sixty (60) days, the application is no longer valid, and the individual must begin a new
application.
When an individual receives a background check clearance, the agency must assess if they
are fit for employment based on the results. When an agency becomes aware of any
subsequent criminal convictions or child or adult protection issues, they must report the
information immediately to the Background Check Unit.
The agency may use the results of a previously completed background check at their
discretion in some circumstances. The clearance from the background check must be within
three (3) years of its determination. An individual is not eligible to provide services until the
July 1, 2025 Page 15 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
agency has linked the clearance to their profile on the Department’s website and completed
a state-only background check through the Idaho State Police with no disqualifying incidents
being returned.
Individuals receiving unconditional denials or inability to proceed are immediately unable to
work. The Department may allow background check variances for clearance requirements at
its discretion on a case-by-case basis with consideration of the underlying facts and
circumstances.
The Department may require a new background check at any time. If requested, the individual
must provide a completed application and fingerprints within fourteen (14) days to maintain
their eligibility to provide services. The Department may revoke a background check clearance
when the individual fails to submit a new background check upon request, a subsequent
background check finds a disqualifying incident, or fees are not paid in full.
All background check applications, clearances, denials, and results from an Idaho State Policy
background check must be retained by the agency and available upon request for five (5)
years from separation of employment.

1.4.3. Denials or Inability to Proceed
An individual who receives an unconditional denial or inability finding may not provide

1.4.4. Background Check Variances
Variances allow an individual to provide specific services when ineligible for a clearance. The
Department may allow a variance for clearance requirements at its discretion on a case-by-
case basis with consideration of the underlying facts and circumstances. Variances are not
considered clearances and may be revoked at any time if a health or safety risk is identified.
A granted variance does not set a precedent for future reviews. Medicaid peer support and
recovery coaching providers can apply for a variance if their background check results in a
denial due to prior convictions for drug and alcohol-related offenses. Factors for consideration
include, but are not limited to the:
• Severity or nature of the crime or finding;
• Time period since the incidents occurred;
• Number and pattern of incidents;
• Circumstances that may determine risk of recidivism;
• Relationship between the incidents and the position applied for;
• Evidence of activities demonstrating rehabilitation;
• Pardons by a state governor or the President of the United States; and
• Falsification or omission of information during the application process.

2. Participant Financial Responsibility
Providers rendering items or services to a participant must bill any third-party liable payor
and Idaho Medicaid. Any payment made by Idaho Medicaid must be accepted as payment in
full. This also includes claims with third-party liability where Medicaid’s reimbursement
methodology considers the third-party payment to have covered the claim in full and no
additional amount is paid by Medicaid. Providers cannot refuse to provide covered services
because of potential third-party liability.
Unless stated otherwise by the Department (e.g. Idaho Medicaid co-pays and share of cost)
no additional payment may be collected from the participant either before or after Medicaid
payment, regardless of a separate contract between the participant and the provider for
assumption of liability. This includes, but is not limited to:
• No-show or missed appointment fees;
• Other insurer’s co-pays;
• Failure on the part of the provider to submit a complete and correct claim to the
Department or other payor;
• Failure by the provider to submit a complete and correct request for prior authorization
from the Department or other payor;
• Claims voided by the provider;
• Failure of the provider to follow any payor’s policy or procedure; or
• Any recoupment or penalties the provider receives as a result of their action or
inaction.
Providers may bill a participant when a third-party payment (e.g. automotive insurance
adjustment) was made to the participant instead of the provider, in which case the participant
may be billed for an amount equal to that payment.
Providers can only bill participants for non-covered or excluded items and services, if prior to
rendering such services or providing such items, the provider informed the participant through
a written notice that what they are receiving is not covered under Medicaid. Idaho Medicaid
does not have an official format, but the notice must specify the non-covered/excluded service
or item, the cost of each service or item, and be signed by the participant. If the participant
chooses to obtain services not covered or excluded by Medicaid, it is the participant’s
responsibility to pay for the services. See the Non-Covered and Excluded Services section for
more information.
Providers are exempt from the requirement to notify the participant in writing for services
provided during any period where the participant was later found retroactively eligible for
Medicaid coverage. However, providers must adhere to all other requirements of being a
Medicaid provider. If the provider previously collected a payment that would not be allowed
by Idaho Medicaid from a participant later found eligible, the payment must be refunded.
See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information
about billing non-covered services under GA, GX, GY and GZ modifiers, third-party liability,
co-payments, share of cost and reimbursement methodologies.

2.2. Co-payments
Some participants may be subject to a co-payment. When a provider verifies a participant’s
eligibility for the service, a co-payment indicator of “Exempt” or $3.65 displays. Participants
may only be charged a co-payment as specified by the provider handbook and when the
reimbursement amount for the service is more than $36.50 in the Medicaid Fee Schedule.
Services for wellness including preventive exams, and all medically necessary immunizations
or family planning services are excluded from co-pay.
These services are subject to a co-payment:
• Ambulance services for a non-emergency;
• Chiropractic;
• Emergency room services for a non-emergency;
• Podiatric;
• Eye and vision services provided by an optometrist;
• Therapy Services;
• Medical Services; and
• IHS, FQHC and RHC Services.
The provider is responsible for collection of the copayment. Routinely waiving co-payments
could be a violation of the anti-kickback statute. When the co-payment is applicable, the
provider’s reimbursement is reduced by the amount of the co-payment regardless of whether
or not the co-payment was charged or collected by the provider. If a participant subject to a
co-payment is unable to make a payment, the provider may:
• Bill the participant for the co-payment;
• Refuse to provide services at that time for participants with incomes above 100% of
the federal poverty level (FPL); or
• Waive the co-payment on a case-by-case basis when the provider has a written policy
describing the criteria for waiving and enforcing collection of co-payments.

2.3. Share of Cost (SOC)
Share of Cost (SOC) is a financial arrangement for a participant to pay a specific portion of
the monthly costs associated with a service. Share of Cost is associated to participants eligible
for the Adult Developmental Disabilities (DD) Waiver, Aged and Disabled Waiver (A&D), or
residing in Skilled Nursing (SNF) or Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with
Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) Facilities (i.e., Long Term Care).
There are three (3) eligibility categories (referred to as Rate Codes):
• Rate Code 14: Developmental Disability Waiver;
• Rate Code 15: Aged and Disabled Waiver; and
• Rate Code 17: Skilled Nursing Facilities (Long Term Care) or ICF/IID Facilities.
It is the provider’s responsibility to verify the participant’s SOC each month and collect this
from the participant. The provider’s allowable reimbursement is reduced by the amount of the
applicable SOC on a first claim in basis until the full amount of the SOC has been offset. Refer
to Verifying Participant Eligibility and the Eligibility Verification section of the Trading Partner
Account (TPA) User Guide.
Claims submitted with an applicable SOC must not span over multiple months. They must be
billed within a single month on a claim.
2.3.1. Discrepancy Contact Information
If the participant or provider believes that the SOC amount is based on outdated or incomplete
information, the participant or participant’s personal representative should contact Self
Reliance at 1 (877) 456-1233 to review the information used in the SOC calculation.
If there is a variance between the SOC identified in the participant’s notification letter and
what was reported on the participants SOC eligibility verification, send an e-mail to
SOCdiscrepancies@dhw.idaho.gov, or fax to 1 (208) 334-5571 using the Fax Cover Sheet
found on the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website, under Gainwell Technologies
Forms.
2.3.2. Paid Claim Discrepancies
If there is a variance between the amount of SOC offset on a claim and the amount reported
during the SOC participant eligibility verification, the provider can complete the Nursing Home
and Waiver Share of Cost (SOC) Review Request form e-mailed to
idnursinghomes@gainwelltechnologies.com. This form is available online under Gainwell
Technologies Forms. The instructions to fill out the form are in the same location. All fields in
the forms are required.

3. Fraud, Waste and Abuse
3.1. Reporting Provider Fraud
The Medicaid Program Integrity Unit (MPIU) conducts reviews and investigations to determine
whether or not a provider is incorrectly billing Medicaid. The MPIU also conducts random
studies of provider payment histories to detect billing errors and over-utilization. They
perform on-site visits and obtain records to verify that services billed correspond to services
rendered to participants. Once services are reviewed, issues may be resolved by provider
education or policy revision, recovery of funds from the provider, and/or assessment of civil
monetary penalties. In more serious cases, the Department can take any or all of the following
actions:
• Suspend payment pending further investigation;
• Terminate provider numbers;
• Exclude entities/individuals;
• Refer individuals/providers for criminal prosecution.
If you believe that a particular Medicaid provider is abusing the program, you may contact:

3.2. Self-Reporting Overpayments
Providers aware of an overpayment by the Department must immediately repay the improper
amount. If an overpayment is identified within the time frame allowed for a claim adjustment,
providers should adjust their claims per the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid
Provider Handbook. If the overpayment is identified after the allowed adjustment period,
providers can submit the Overpayment Form to Gainwell Technologies for claim adjustments.
Providers who want to self-report overpayments and send a lump sum payment or enter into
a repayment agreement to pay back the overpayment over time, should fill out and submit
the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit’s online Health Care Provider Self Report form. Providers
who submit the online Health Care Provider Self-Report forms are contacted by the Medicaid
Program Integrity Unit within five (5) working days to discuss repayment.
Incentives are extended to providers who responsibly self-report including:
• Extended repayment terms;
• Waiver of civil monetary penalties;
o Civil monetary penalties cannot be waived for background check compliance
cases, but an audit would not include all employees; and
• Quick resolution of overpayments.
Situations that could cause an overpayment include, but are not limited to:
• Incorrect coding or billing;
• Services provided by an unlicensed or excluded individual; and
• Claims submitted for services that were billed but not provided.

3.3. Prevention Requirements
Providers are responsible to establish, disseminate, and enforce written policies that detect
and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse to their employees, contractors, and subcontractors.
The provider’s employee handbooks must include references to the laws in the written
policies, protections for whistleblowers, and specific discussion of policies and procedures in
compliance with the False Claims Act of 1863 and Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. These
handbooks must be available to all employees, contractors, and agents.
Additionally, entities receiving payments totaling $5,000,000 or more per year must provide
the Department with an annual written affidavit attesting to their compliance with these laws.
Each year the Division of Medicaid sends reminder letters to entities determined to meet this
requirement.
Compliance with these laws is a condition of payment. Failure to comply results in termination
of the provider contract, and potential recoupment and penalties. Providers are encouraged
to use the Office of Inspector General’s Compliance Resource Portal for best practices and
complimentary trainings.

3.4. Payment Error Rate Measurement Audits
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the Payment Error Rate
Measurement (PERM) program to measure improper payments in Medicaid and the State
Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by reviewing claim payments and participant
eligibility determinations every three (3) years. CMS uses a Review Contractor (RC) to
perform medical records collection, statistical calculations, medical data, and a processing
review of fee-for-service (FFS) claims. The RC selects a sample of claims and calls affected
providers to explain the process to establish a point of contact for the audit. The RC then
sends each provider a written request by fax or mail detailing the documents needed.
Documentation must be submitted per the RC’s instructions including the PERM coversheet
and within seventy-five (75) calendar days. If the documentation submitted is insufficient to
support the claim, additional documentation is requested. Providers only have fourteen (14)
days to comply with any additional requests. It is important that providers cooperate by
submitting all requested documentation within the designated timeframe. Failure to provide
the requested documentation in the designated time frame is a violation of Idaho Code Section
56-209h and the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, which may result in disenrollment,
investigation, recoupment and/or civil monetary penalties.
Medical staff and certified coders review the claims and documentation provided to the RC
ensuring payment was appropriate based on the Department’s policy, state and federal
regulations. Non-compliant claims are recouped by the Department, and to avoid future
issues, the provider may be required to submit a corrective action plan. Additionally, the
Medicaid Fraud Control Unit or the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit may investigate providers
suspected of fraud or abuse. Providers are still entitled to their normal appeal rights with the
Department.
The Department monitors PERM audits and follows up with providers and the RC as necessary.
This includes reviewing audit results and providing the RC additional information when
findings are incorrect. Providers may email their State PERM contact at
permaudit@dhw.idaho.gov or CMS at PERMProviders@cms.hhs.gov for any provider specific
questions.

3.5. Retrospective Review
A retrospective review is a determination of coverage after a claim has been submitted. It
may even occur after payment has been made. Should a review find that payment for a claim
was inappropriate, it may be recouped. The review checks for appropriate documentation,
medical necessity, and adherence to all applicable rules, regulations, and statutes. Receipt of
documentation and claim payment is not certification that the Department has conducted a
review or verified the appropriateness of a claim.
Providers may appeal a finding on a retrospective review by Medicaid or its designee by
requesting a reconsideration. If the provider disagrees with the result of the reconsideration,
they may file a formal appeal.
3.5.1. Reconsideration Request
Prepare a written Request for Reconsideration including additional documentation to support
the validity of your claim. Documentation may include medical records, guidance from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Idaho Provider Handbooks, Idaho statute, or Idaho
Administrative Procedure Acts (IDAPA). Resubmit to the reviewing agent within 28 days from
the mailing date of the Notice of Decision.
Upon completion of the reconsideration review, Medicaid will issue a second Notice of
Decision. If the provider or participant disagrees with the reconsideration decision made by
Medicaid or its designee, they may file a Request for Appeal. The provider or participant has
28 days from the mailing date of the second Notice of Decision to submit a formal appeal.
3.5.2. Appeal Request
A formal appeal must be submitted in writing with supporting documentation within 28 days
of the date of the Medicaid Review of Claim Determination to:
Division of Medicaid
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare
P.O. Box 83720
Boise, ID 83720-0036
Fax: 1 (208) 364-1811
MedicaidAppeals@dhw.idaho.gov
Submit a cover letter detailing the reason a formal appeal is requested along with copies of
the flowing information:
• Medicaid Review of claim Determination Letter
• Gainwell Technologies review letter
• Claim and all attachments or new claim for possible resubmission
• Any applicable Remittance Advice (RA)
Medicaid will review the claim and respond in writing with a final determination.

3.6. Services for Immediate Family or Household Member
The Department reimburses providers based on the lesser of reasonable costs or customary
charges for services and items. The definition for customary charges includes the provision
for Medicare rates, which considers items and services furnished to an immediate family or
household member to be without charge or no charge due to the relationship between the
participant and the provider. Unless otherwise stated providers cannot be reimbursed for
services provided to a participant within their immediate family or household.
For physicians and non-physician practitioners this also includes services that are incidental
to their care. This section does not apply to a non-professional corporation regardless of the
relationship with any employee, stockholder, officer or director. It does apply to a professional
corporation, which is any corporation owned by healthcare professionals for the purpose of
practicing medicine, midwifery, dentistry, podiatry, optometry, or chiropractic care.
Providers are encouraged to consult their professional organization’s stance on these services
as many organizations such as the American Medical Association consider the treatment of
self or an individual with a close personal relationship in violation of their ethical standards.
3.6.1. Immediate Family Definition
An immediate family member is:
• A spouse;
• A natural, step, in-law, or adopted child;
• A natural, step, in-law, or adopted parent;
• A person acting in loco parentis;
• A natural, step, in-law, or adopted sibling;
• A natural, step, in-law, or adopted grandchild; or
• A natural, step, in-law, or adopted grandparent.
The spouse of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law is not considered an immediate family
member. Familial bonds remain in effect in the event of the death of one of the parties.
3.6.2. Household Member Definition
A household member is anyone living in the provider’s residence with a relationship based on
blood, adoption, marriage, or employment. Roommates and renters are not considered a
member of the provider’s household. However, services provided for a roommate or renter
are still excluded from reimbursement when they are an immediate family member.

Household Member

3.7. Prohibition on Gifts to Participants
Providers are prohibited from offering gifts or incentives to participants and may be liable for
a civil monetary penalty up to $10,000 per occurrence as well as exclusion from Federal
programs for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. This includes waivers of co-payments and
the transfer of items or services for free or below the fair market value. There are some
allowances such as:
• Nominal gifts other than cash and valued up to $15 per item, but not more than $75
annually;
• Items or services offered on equal terms to the general public, regardless of insurance
status;
• Payments between an employer and employee;
• Waivers of cost-sharing payments not advertised and based on financial need;
• Incentives to promote the delivery of preventive care services to any participant, or
services in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services by the United States Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF);
• Drug manufacturers that do not file claims with Medicaid; and
• Independent provider funded entities furnishing services to the financially needy that
do not require participants receive services from a particular provider.

4.1. Idaho Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS)
Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) is the interactive voice response system (IVR)
that allows a computer to recognize voice and telephone keypad inputs. MACS will allow users
to access a database via a telephone touchtone keypad or by speech recognition, after which
they can service their own inquiries by following the instructions. MACS will respond with pre-
recorded audio to further direct users on how to proceed. MACS can be used to control almost
any function where the system can be broken down into a series of simple menu choices.
The following table shows the information available through MACS. The phone number for

4.2. Benefit Eligibility Checks
Providers must verify and document participant eligibility and Healthy Connections enrollment
status on the date of service and prior to rendering services to qualify for reimbursement.
More information about checking participant eligibility is in the Verifying Participant Eligibility
section of the handbook. Gainwell Technologies provides the ability for providers to verify
billing code coverage as well. Due to system limitations, the system shows all codes residing
in a single benefit category. It does not show benefits specific to the participant. Gainwell
does try to name the benefits that apply to a particular age group. Providers should be aware
of this system limitation when determining whether a participant is eligible for a service.
Furthermore, providers must abide by the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. When a
limitation is stated in the handbook, the provider is responsible for ensuring they do not
exceed that limitation regardless of the system check.

5. Provider Enrollment
Providers must be enrolled before billing or providing services except in emergency
circumstances or as detailed in the provider handbook. Idaho Medicaid enrolls four types of
providers:
• Providers with full billing privileges
• Crossover only providers
• Managed care organization/ordering, referring and prescribing only providers
(MCO/ORP)
• Non-billing ordering, referring and prescribing (ORP) providers
All providers wishing to participate in the Idaho Medicaid program must first register for a
Trading Partner Account (TPA) at https://www.idmedicaid.com and then follow the link for
the Provider Enrollment Application upon logging in. A complete application includes a
Medicaid Provider Agreement and a W-9, which must be signed by the provider and submitted
with the enrollment application along with other attachments to Gainwell Technologies
through their website. The date of enrollment is considered the date a complete application
is submitted. Enrollment can be backdated up to a year from the date of application in some
circumstances.
Individual providers enrolling must disclose information, including, but not limited to:
• Date of birth (DOB);
• Social Security Number (SSN);
• Licensure;
• National Provider Identifier (if applicable); and
• Convictions of any criminal offense related to the person’s involvement in any program
under Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP since those programs began.
All owners, corporate officers, directors, or shareholders of legal entities to include the
following: general or limited corporations; partnerships; professional corporations or
associations; limited liability companies with a direct, indirect or control interest; managed
care organizations AND managing employees or fiscal agents who exercise day-to-day
operational or managerial control or operations must also disclose information upon
enrollment in Medicaid. A disclosing entity is defined as “a Medicaid provider (other than an
individual practitioner or group of practitioners), or a fiscal agent.” Both individuals and
entities must disclose family relationships between persons with ownership or control interests
in the disclosing entity. Disclosing entities must also disclose:
• Names and addresses of any person with an ownership or control interest in the
disclosing entity;
• Names, addresses, DOBs, and SSNs of any managing employee or fiscal agent of the
disclosing entity;
• Whether a person with an ownership interest is related to another person with an
ownership or control interest;
• Names of other disclosing entities in which the owner, managing employee or fiscal
agent has ownership or control interest regardless of the percentage of ownership;
• Convictions of persons who have ownership or control interests in the provider entity;
• Convictions of persons who are managing employees or fiscal agents of the provider
entity; and
• Whether any person with an ownership or control interest, a managing employee or a
fiscal agent has voluntarily revoked, terminated or been subject to a revocation or
termination action of a Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP enrollment as defined by 42 CFR
455.107.

5.2. Crossover Only Providers
Healthcare professionals and facilities that do not wish to be Medicaid providers can instead
choose to enroll as crossover only providers to receive coinsurance and deductible payments
for participants dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Enrollment as a crossover only
provider also allows the professional to be an Ordering, Referring and Prescribing Providers
when they meet all other requirements. This enrollment option is not for providers wanting
to submit claims to Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for non-Medicare services or
participants with Medicaid only.
Providers wishing to enroll as a crossover only provider must complete an enrollment
application with their Medicare certification, sign the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement, and
retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of medical
necessity. This enrollment is for professional services only. If an enrolled provider later
chooses to start billing Idaho Medicaid for these services, they can contact Provider Enrollment
for instructions on converting their account.
See General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information
about reimbursement for participants dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.
5.2.1. Mental Health Clinics
Idaho Medicaid’s behavioral health and substance use disorder services are usually covered
under the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan (IBHP) with benefits administered under contract by
Magellan Healthcare, Inc. However, participants with only Medicare Savings Plan eligibility or
dual eligible participants enrolled in the Idaho Medicaid Plus or Medicare Medicaid Coordinated
Plan (MMCP), do not receive benefits under the IBHP. Mental Health Clinics providing services
to these participants when eligible are reimbursed through Fee-For-Service Medicaid or under
the dual health plan in which they are enrolled. The clinic must enroll as a crossover only
provider with a group NPI or service location with all Medicare certified staff as rendering
providers (e.g. Licensed Clinical Social Workers).

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
5.3. Managed Care Organization/Ordering, Referring and
Prescribing Providers
Healthcare professionals and facilities providing services to a Medicaid managed care
organization are required to enroll with Idaho Medicaid. Providers that do not wish to be fee-
for-service Medicaid providers can instead choose to enroll as non-billing entities. This
enrollment also allows for the provider to order, refer, or prescribe services and items,
allowing participants enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid to fill prescriptions or another Idaho
Medicaid provider to accept a referral. Providers wishing to enroll as managed care
organization/non-billing ordering, referring and prescribing (MCO/ORP) providers must
complete an enrollment application, sign the MCO/ORP Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement,
and retain all documentation to support services ordered including the establishment of
medical necessity. The Department has established a streamlined process to enroll non-billing
individuals. This enrollment method is not for providers who want to submit claims directly to
Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for their services. If an enrolled non-billing provider later
chooses to start billing fee-for-service Idaho Medicaid, they can contact Provider Enrollment
for instructions on converting their account.

Non-billing Ordering, Referring and Prescribing
5.4. Providers
Healthcare professionals that do not wish to be Medicaid providers can instead choose to
enroll as non-billing entities for the sole purpose of ordering, referring, or prescribing services
and items. This allows participants to fill prescriptions or an Idaho Medicaid provider to accept
a referral. Providers wishing to enroll as non-billing ordering, referring and prescribing
providers must complete an enrollment application, sign the Idaho Medicaid Provider
Agreement, and retain all documentation to support services ordered including the
establishment of medical necessity. The Department established a streamlined process to
enroll non-billing individuals whose only relationship with the Idaho Medicaid program is to
refer for specialized care or order items or services. This enrollment is for individuals only,
not facilities or provider group entities. Call Idaho Medicaid Provider Enrollment toll free at 1
(866) 686-4272 for a non-billing provider enrollment form. This enrollment method is not for
individuals who want to submit claims to Idaho Medicaid for reimbursement for their services.
If an enrolled non-billing provider later chooses to start billing Idaho Medicaid, they can
contact Provider Enrollment for instructions on converting their account.

5.5. Medicaid Provider Identification Numbers
5.5.1. Individual Provider Numbers
The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a requirement of HIPAA. The NPI must be used on all
electronic claims and identifies healthcare providers to health plans with a unique 10-digit
numeric provider identifier. An NPI can only be associated to one Tax ID, but a Tax ID can be
associated to many NPI numbers or Idaho Medicaid Provider numbers. Providers who
registered in the MMIS with an NPI will use that NPI on all paper or electronic transactions.
Reimbursement for providers with an NPI is sent to the pay-to address associated with the
NPI. Providers without an NPI can apply for one online at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/#/ or
by calling 1 (800) 465-3203 for a paper application.
Provider-types that do not meet the HIPAA definition of a healthcare provider are considered
atypical provider types. Atypical providers are generally not eligible to receive an NPI. Instead
a unique 8-digit Idaho Medicaid Provider Number is assigned during enrollment. Claim
reimbursement is sent to the pay-to address associated with the Medicaid provider number.
The types of providers Idaho Medicaid recognizes as atypical provider types are listed below:
• Adult day health facility;
• Behavior consultation/crisis management;
• Certified family homes;
• Chore service providers;
• Community support workers;
• Home delivered meal providers;
• Home modification contractors;
• Non-medical transportation agency and individual providers;
• Non-emergency and/or non-medical commercial transportation;
• Personal Assistance Agency (PCS/aged and disabled (A&D) agency);
• Personal Care Services (PCS) Family Alternate Care Home (FACH);
• Personal emergency response system (PERS) providers;
• Residential Assisted Living Facility (RALF);
• Residential habilitation agency;
• Respite care providers;
• Self-determination fiscal employer agent;
• Supported employment agency;
• Transition mangers; and
• Transportation providers.
5.5.2. Multiple Service Locations
Providers with multiple service locations must identify where the service took place. A service
location is considered separate from the primary location when one of the following applies:
• The location is off-campus from the primary demonstrated by:
o The site is not immediately adjacent to the main building.
o The site is more than 250 yards from the main building.
• The site is on-campus but presents itself separately from the primary location.
• The Department determines the site to be a separate service location.
When billing claims, providers with multiple service locations must enter a three-digit site
number (i.e. 001, 002) to identify the specific location, in addition to their NPI/Medicaid ID.
The three-digit location code is identified on the provider enrollment approval letter. Providers
can also obtain this number by logging into their Trading Partner Account to view the
information.
Enter this information in the following fields:

• Paper UB04, enter in field 2;
• Paper CMS-1500, enter in field 32a; or
• Electronic claims refer to 837 Professional/837 Institutional companion guide.
5.5.3. Group Practice
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires the identification of the
individual who actually performs a service when billing under a group number. The performing
provider’s individual NPI/Medicaid provider number must be on the claim as well as the
provider’s group NPI/Medicaid number.
July 1, 2025 Page 53 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
5.6. Provider Qualifications
Idaho Medicaid providers must meet all qualification requirements to be eligible for payment.
Providers are required where appropriate to be licensed, certified, or registered with the
appropriate state and federal authorities. Continued provider participation is contingent on
the ongoing maintenance of required credentials. The claims processing system verifies the
effective dates of the provider’s credentials against the date of service. Provider credentials
must be up to date or claims are denied. Providers are required to split claims for covered
and non-covered dates of service, or update their credentials with Gainwell Technologies and
resubmit the claim. The loss of, or failure to renew, required credentials or insurance is cause
to terminate a provider’s participation in the Idaho Medicaid Program.
Providers are also required to carry any insurance mandated by state or federal regulations,
or Idaho Medicaid. Additional provider qualifications are listed throughout the Idaho Medicaid
Provider Handbook based on provider type or service requirements. Payment of a claim does
not verify that a provider meets qualifications to provide the service. It is the provider’s
responsibility to ensure they meet the qualifications for a service. Providers that do not meet
the qualifications for a paid service may be subject to recoupment and civil or monetary
penalties.

5.7. Ownership and Controlling Interests
Providers with any type of partnership, corporation or nonprofit entity with an executed Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Provider Agreement agree that the entity and the
partners, directors, officers, members, or individuals with an ownership interest of five-
percent (5%) or greater, are jointly and severally liable for any breach of this Provider
Agreement, and that action by the Department against the Provider may result in action
against all such individuals in the entity.
The agreement also stipulates that providers furnish the Department or the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, within thirty-five (35) days of the request, full and complete
information related to certain business transactions, specifically about:
• The ownership of any subcontractor with whom the provider has had business
transactions totaling more than $25,000 during the 12-month period ending on the
date of the request; and
• Any significant business transactions between the provider and any wholly owned
supplier, or between the provider and any subcontractor, during the 5-year period
ending on the date of the request.
Providers are also required in their Provider Agreement to comply with the disclosure of
ownership requirements in 42 CFR Part 455, Subpart B, and 42 CFR 411.361, when as
applicable, and to notify the Department thirty (30) days prior to any change of ownership.
The Provider Agreement is not transferable to the new owner.

5.8. Provider Risk Levels
Medicaid agencies must assign a categorical risk level for each provider type enrolling in the
program. The screening level determines the processes the state must use for enrollment of
new providers and revalidation of existing providers. Whenever appropriate, states are
required to use the same risk level assigned by Medicare or assign a higher risk level. The
screening requirements listed below are in addition to all other provider enrollment
requirements already established.

5.9. Provider Enrollment Moratoria
At its discretion, the Department may request from CMS a temporary prohibition on provider
enrollment for a provider type when necessary to prevent or combat fraud, waste and abuse.
The moratorium lasts for a six-month increment initially and may be repeatedly extended for
the same. Any providers requesting enrollment under such a provider type during a
moratorium must be denied by the Department. At this time Idaho Medicaid does not have a
moratorium in place.

5.10. Maintenance of Information
Providers shall notify the Department of any changes to the information contained in the
Enrollment Application, including but not limited to their mailing address and service locations,
within 30 days of the date of the change. The Department is required by Federal regulations
to terminate a provider’s enrollment for failure to submit timely and correct information, which
may also affect the provider’s enrollment in other states’ Medicaid programs. The Department
may allow a provider to keep their enrollment if it documents in writing that termination would
not be in the best interests of the Medicaid program. Failure to keep information current may
also result in recoupment and civil or monetary penalties.
After enrolling, any updates needed to the provider file can be done through the online portal
at the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. Once logged into your Trading Partner
Account (TPA), select the Provider Enrollment Application link to electronically maintain
your provider record.
Provider record changes include, but are not limited to:
• Change in address
• New phone number
• Name change (individual, group practice, etc.)
• Change in ownership or tax identification information
• Change in provider status (voluntary inactive, retired, etc.)
• Add/update/end date of rendering provider
• Add/update/end date of service locations
All correspondence sent to the provider’s mailing address on file with the State’s fiscal agent
is deemed to be received by the Provider. Department correspondence is not forwarded by a
change of address with the U.S. Postal Service. All mail and checks are returned to Gainwell
Technologies.
To update or enroll additional provider records, visit the Provider Enrollment User Guides.

5.11. Change in Ownership or Tax Identification
Information
Please be advised that a change in ownership or tax identification information requires a
NEW provider enrollment application. The Idaho Medicaid provider agreement IS NOT
transferable. Notification of a change must be made to the Department timely, within 35-
days.
The following are examples of changes of ownership. This list is not exhaustive. In all the
examples below, a new provider enrollment IS required and the existing record must be
termed. Providers who are unsure of whether a transaction constitutes a change of
ownership should contact the Division of Medicaid.
Examples include:
1. The provider is purchased or leased by another organization resulting in the transfer
of the provider’s identification number.
2. Changes to type of organization (e.g. Partnerships to limited liability company, or
sole proprietorship to organization), which result in an asset or liability change.
3. An acquisition or merger where one entity purchases another. The purchasing entity
typically uses their provider number in place of the selling provider’s.
4. Consolidations, when a new corporate entity is formed, and the merging companies
are non-surviving.
5. Changes in composition of a partnership (i.e. removal, addition, or substitution of
one or more individuals as partners).
6. Transfers, creations or changes in the control of government owned institutions
between different levels of government, such as city to county, state to county, etc..
7. 8. Transfer of title or property to another party.
Leasing of all or part of a provider facility.
9. Bankruptcy proceedings filing.
10. Changes to a facility that require a change in licensure or certification.
Providers are not required to get a new NPI after a change in ownership, however, providers
are encouraged to do so. This allows for a smooth billing transition and tracking of
receivables, along with avoiding NPI crosswalk issues.

5.12. Provider Termination
Idaho Medicaid is required to deny applications for provider status or terminate the Medicaid
Provider Agreement of any provider suspended from the Medicare Program or another state’s
Medicaid program. A provider’s Medicaid status may also be terminated when the provider
fails to comply with any term or provision of the Medicaid Provider Agreement. This includes
failing to notify Idaho Medicaid or Gainwell Technologies in writing of any changes in address
or ownership.
Continued provider participation is contingent on the ongoing maintenance of current
licensure, certification, or insurance. Failure to renew required licenses, certifications, or
insurance is cause to terminate a provider’s participation in the Idaho Medicaid program.

6. Participant Eligibility and Benefit Plan Coverage
Medicaid is a medical assistance program that is jointly funded by the federal and state
governments to assist in providing medical care to individuals. Applicants must meet each of
the financial and non-financial requirements of a program to participate in its benefit plan,
which may include a review of income, resources and other assets. The Division of Self-
Reliance determines Medicaid eligibility and enrolls eligible applicants in the appropriate
benefit package.
General information for participants on services covered under the Idaho Medicaid Program
are listed in the booklet, Idaho Health Plan, which is available in English and Spanish from
the Division of Medicaid, Department Regional Offices, or online. All services fall under either
the Medicaid Basic Plan or Medicaid Enhanced Plan. However, some participants’ eligibility to
receive those services may provide additional restrictions, limitations or benefits not
otherwise available as described below.
See the Provider Handbooks under Provider Guidelines for specific service coverage and billing
details for individual programs and specialties.

6.2. Medicaid Identification Card
An identification card is issued to participants determined eligible for Medicaid benefits. All
Medicaid participants, except otherwise ineligible non-citizens or presumptive eligibility (PE)
participants, receive an identification card. Possession of a Medicaid ID card does not
guarantee Medicaid eligibility or provider payment. Providers should request the Medicaid ID
card with additional picture identification and retain copies of this documentation for their
records.
The participant’s Medicaid identification (MID) number is on the card. Cards issued after June
1, 2010 are a 10-digit number with no letters or symbols. Cards issued prior to June 1, 2010
are seven digits. Providers should convert the older versions by adding three zeroes on the
front of the MID number.
Participants enrolled in the Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) plan or Medicare Medicaid
Coordinated Plan (MMCP) are issued an alternative Medicaid card by their chosen or assigned
health plan.

6.3. Verifying Participant Eligibility
Self-Reliance determines participant eligibility annually and as needed based on reported
changes. Any participant’s eligibility may change from month-to-month. Providers are
required to verify and document participant eligibility and Healthy Connections enrollment
status on the date of service and before providing services to qualify for reimbursement.
Medicaid only reimburses for services rendered to participants eligible for Medicaid benefits
at the time of service. Deceased participants are not eligible for services or items. Providers
are not reimbursed for services or items provided after the participant’s date of death.
Example
A participant is eligible and has Medicaid coverage during the months of April
and June. The participant was found ineligible and didn’t have coverage during
May.
Eligibility information can be accessed three (3) different ways:
• Trading Partner Account (TPA) on Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website;
• MACS 1 (866) 686-4272; or
• HIPAA compliant vendor software (tested with Gainwell Technologies).
To obtain eligibility information from one of these systems, submit two (2) participant
identifiers from the following list:
• MID number;
• Social Security number (SSN);
• Last name, first name; or
• Date of birth.
Available participant eligibility information includes eligibility dates and Healthy Connections
(HC) enrollment data, Medicaid special program limitations, certain service limitations,
procedure code inquiries, third party recovery (TPR), Medicare coverage information, co-
payments, and lock-in data. When viewing participant eligibility on a trading partner account
Healthy Connections information is listed on the “Network” tab. If no information is available,
then the participant is not enrolled with Healthy Connections, and a referral for services is not
required.

6.3.2. Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS)
Providers can use MACS to check participant eligibility. Eligibility information is available on:
• Healthy Connections Program;
• Eligibility with special programs;
• Service limits;
• Prior authorization (PA);
• Co-payments; and
• Other health coverage.
MACS informs providers of the type of Medicaid benefits a participant is eligible for on the
dates of service. More information about MACS is found in the Idaho Medicaid Automated
Customer Service (Idaho MACS) section of this handbook.
Participants eligible for the full range of Medicaid services have their benefit plans
communicated as eligible for Medicaid benefits. Participants, such as those on hospice, who
are not eligible for the full range of Medicaid services have their restrictions reported according
to their benefit plan.
Example
A participant eligible for the Medicaid Basic Plan has their eligibility
communicated as eligible for basic Medicaid benefits, and only benefits
restricted to the basic plan are communicated.
The benefit plan parameters for Presumptive Eligibility (PE), Lock-in, and Co-pay remain
unchanged and any restrictions or requirements for participants are communicated
accordingly.
6.3.3. Trading Partner Account (TPA)
Information regarding online billing and eligibility verification can be found in the Trading
Partner Account (TPA) User Guide. When verifying eligibility, the following information is
provided for participants enrolled in Healthy Connections:
• Network of HC clinic:
o Healthy Connections;
o Healthy Connections Care Management;
o Healthy Connections Medical Home; and
o Exempt from Healthy Connections.
• Demographics of the HC clinic:
o Name of HC clinic;
o Address of HC clinic;
o Phone number of HC clinic; and
o Hours of operation of HC clinic.
6.3.4. Vendor Supplied Software
Providers may contract with a software vendor and use software supplied by the vendor.
Software specifications can be found on the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website by
selecting Companion Guides under the Reference Material menu. The specifications assist the
vendor in duplicating the program requirements and allows providers to obtain the same
information available as the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. All vendor
software must successfully test transactions with Gainwell Technologies before use. Providers
can check eligibility using vendor software, if the software is modified to meet the
July 1, 2025 Page 67 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
requirements of the HIPAA ASC X12 270/271, version 5010 format, and if the vendor
successfully tests the transactions with Gainwell Technologies.

Providers required to submit EVV data through the Sandata EVV Aggregator may contract
with any EVV software vendor of their choice as long as the software is certified as compatible
by Sandata. EVV software specifications (OpenEVV-AltEVV) can be found on the Idaho
Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website by selecting Companion Guides under the Reference
Material menu. The specifications assist the vendor in duplicating the EVV program
requirements and allows providers to obtain the same information available as Sandata. All
providers must successfully test and certify their EVV software with Sandata to verify
compatibility with the EVV Aggregator in order to be eligible for payment. See the General
Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information.

6.4. Participant Program Abuse/Lock-In Program
Medicaid reviews participant utilization to determine if services are being used at a frequency
or amount that may be delivered at a level harmful to the participant and to identify services
that are not medically necessary. Abuse can include frequent use of emergency room facilities
for non-emergent conditions, frequent use of multiple controlled substances, use of multiple
prescribing physicians and/or pharmacies, excessive provider visits, overlapping prescription
drugs in the same drug class, and drug seeking behavior as identified by a medical
professional.
To prevent abuse, Medicaid has implemented the participant lock-in program. Participants
identified as abusing or over-utilizing the program may be limited to emergency services only,
or the use of one physician/provider and one pharmacy. Services outside of documented
emergencies by other providers will not be reimbursed. This prevents these participants from
going from doctor to doctor, or from pharmacy to pharmacy, to obtain excessive services.
Participants entered in the Lock-in program will be notified by the Department in writing and
have thirty-five (35) days to designate a physician/provider and pharmacy or twenty-eight
(28) days to file an appeal. If a participant does not make a selection or file an appeal, they
will be restricted to services for documented emergencies only and may be suspended from
receiving Medicaid if abuse continues.
If a provider suspects a Medicaid participant is demonstrating utilization patterns, which may
be considered abusive, not medically necessary, potentially endangering the participant’s
health and safety, or drug seeking behavior in obtaining prescription drugs, they should notify
Medicaid of their concerns. Medicaid will review the participant’s medical history to determine
whether the participant is a candidate for the lock-in program.

6.4.2. Primary Care Physician
The primary care physician (PCP) for lock-in participants is responsible for coordination of
routine medical care and making referrals to specialists as necessary. The PCP educates the
lock-in participant on procedures to follow when the office is closed, or there is an urgent or
emergency situation. This coordination of care and the participant’s knowledge of office
procedures should help reduce non-emergent use of the emergency room.
If the participant needs to see a physician other than the PCP, the PCP gives the participant
a referral to another physician or clinic to ensure payment. See the Referrals section for more
information.
If a PCP no longer wishes to provide services to the lock-in participant, the PCP must send a
written notice to the participant stating the reasons for dismissal with a copy of the letter sent
to the Healthy Connections Representative for that region.
6.4.3. Designated Pharmacy
A designated pharmacy must monitor the participant’s pattern of drug use. The pharmacy
should only fill prescriptions from the participant’s primary care physician (PCP), or from
referred physicians as confirmed by the pharmacy with the PCP.

6.5. Idaho Medicaid State Plans
Idaho Medicaid offers three (3) State Plan benefit packages for participants based on various
eligibility criteria.
6.5.1. Medicaid Basic Plan
The Medicaid Basic Plan is designed to achieve and maintain participant wellness by
emphasizing prevention and proactively managing health. It is the default plan for Medicaid
participants.
Under some circumstances, participants in the Medicaid Basic Plan with a medical necessity
for enhanced services may be eligible for enrollment in the Medicaid Enhanced Plan. This
determination is made jointly by Self Reliance in the Division of Welfare and the appropriate
bureau in the Division of Medicaid.
6.5.2. Medicaid Enhanced Plan
The Medicaid Enhanced Plan includes all of the benefits found in the Medicaid Basic Plan, and
additional benefits designed to cover needs of participants with disabilities and/or other
special healthcare needs. Participants enrolled in this plan are eligible for the full range of
Medicaid covered services.
6.5.3. Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP)
The MMCP includes all of the benefits found in the Medicaid Basic Plan and the Medicaid
Enhanced Plan. Participants enrolled in this plan are eligible for the full range of Medicaid
covered services in coordination with their Medicare covered benefits. Participants in this plan
may receive Medicaid benefits under fee-for-service or may be enrolled in either the Idaho
Medicaid Plus or MMCP health plan under a contracted Managed Care Organization (MCO).

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
6.6. Idaho Medicaid Waivers
Idaho Medicaid has two (2) home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers to offer
additional benefit packages for participants based on level of care needs. The participant must
require services due to their disability that impairs their mental or physical function or
independence. They must also be capable of being safely and effectively maintained in a non-
institutional setting that in the absence of would require residence in an intermediate care
facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) or nursing facility.
6.6.1. Aged and Disabled Waiver
Participants on the Medicaid Enhanced Plan and MMCP Plan are eligible for the Aged and
Disabled (A&D) Waiver when they meet nursing facility level of care as determined by the
Bureau of Long Term Care (BLTC). The waiver provides additional benefits designed to cover
the needs of elderly and disabled adult participants to maintain self-sufficiency, individuality,
independence, dignity, choice, and privacy in a cost-effective home-like setting. These
services are intended to encourage the involvement of natural supports such as family,
friends, neighbors, volunteers, religious community, and others.
6.6.2. Developmental Disability Waiver
Participants on the Medicaid Enhanced Plan and MMCP Plan are eligible for the Developmental
Disability (DD) Waiver. The waiver provides additional benefits designed to cover the needs
of participants with disabilities and/or other special healthcare needs. The participant must
be eighteen (18) years of age or older and meet the intermediate care facility for people with
intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) level of care requirements. The participant must have a
diagnosis of being intellectually disabled or a condition defined in section 66-402, Idaho Code.
A functional assessment, maladaptive behavior or medical condition is used to qualify.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
6.7. Presumptive Eligibility (PE)
Presumptive Eligibility (PE) assists Idaho residents not currently receiving medical assistance
from the state or county and who do not have sufficient resources for private medical
coverage. PE provides immediate, presumed coverage for qualified candidates. The maximum
coverage period is 45 days while the participant applies for full coverage. A Medicaid enrolled
hospital with a current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department for PE
may provide assistance to individuals completing and submitting applications for health
coverage. Staff must receive Department approved training in PE before they can complete
an application and make a PE determination. A record of this training must be maintained and
available to the Department upon request. For more information on the training process,
please contact your local DHW eligibility office or visit the Presumptive Eligibility Providers
webpage.
PE is only available for the groups below when they meet all other eligibility criteria:
• Children up to age nineteen (19);
• Parents or caretaker relatives of eligible children;
• Pregnant women (See the Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women (PW) section
for restrictions);
• Adults age eighteen (18) to twenty-six (26) who were in foster care in any state on
their 18th birthday; and
• Individuals twenty-one (21) through sixty-five (65) years of age requiring treatment
for breast and cervical cancer diagnosed under the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP)
(See the Breast and Cervical Cancer (BCC) Program section for more information).
PE determinations are reimbursable using HCPC T1023 (Screening to determine the
appropriateness of consideration of an individual for participation in a specified program,
project or treatment protocol, per encounter). Claims must include the participant’s full name,
MID number and date of birth.

6.8. Breast and Cervical Cancer (BCC) Program
The Breast and Cervical Cancer (BCC) program allows the state to provide Medicaid benefits
to uninsured participants, who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, when they need
treatment for breast or cervical cancer, including pre-cancerous conditions and early stage
cancer. In order to be eligible, an applicant must be initially screened and diagnosed through
a local Women’s Health Check Office (usually the district health department) participating in
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Breast and Cervical Cancer
Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP).
Medicaid coverage lasts for the duration of their cancer treatment, and ends when a
participant’s plan of care reflects a status of surveillance, follow-up or maintenance.
Additionally, coverage ends if a participant’s treatment relies on an unproven procedure in
lieu of primary or adjuvant treatment methods.
The applicant can be presumed eligible as described in Presumptive Eligibility (PE) before a
formal Medicaid determination. Although Medicaid resource limits do not apply, the applicant
must:
• Have an income between 138% and 250% of the federal poverty level;
• Be diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the Women’s Health Check
Program;
• Be at least twenty-one (21) years old and under the age of sixty-five (65);
• Have no creditable health insurance (if insured, the plan does not cover the same type
of cancer);
• Be an Idaho resident;
• Be a U.S. citizen or meet requirements for legal noncitizen;
• Not reside in an ineligible institution; and
• Not be fleeing prosecution of a felony, custody, or confinement of a felony conviction
or violating a condition of probation or parole.

6.9. Early & Periodic Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment
The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit was designed to
help ensure that all Medicaid-eligible participants under the age of twenty-one (21) receive
preventive health care and early intervention services needed to maximize each participant’s
potential for healthy growth and development. The benefit allows participants to receive
additional services not typically covered for adults and increase access to services with
limitations on amount, duration, frequency and location (e.g., hourly and/or location limits on
Personal Care Services). Services not typically allowed due to duplication, overlap and/or
multiple services at the same time and/or date of service may be considered when the services
are medically necessary. Idaho Medicaid does not have an expenditure cap or wait list for
services covered under EPSDT, however, providers may have a waitlist for appointments or
scheduling procedures.
Providers of EPSDT services have all of the same requirements as other providers of their
type and specialty.
Services can only be covered under EPSDT when the service is:
• Determined to be medical in nature;
• Safe, effective and generally recognized as an accepted method of medical practice or
treatment;
• Not determined to be experimental, investigational or cosmetic in nature;
• Under a category of service listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act;
• Medically necessary to correct or ameliorate (needed to sustain or support) an illness
or a health condition;
• For an illness or health condition diagnosed by a physician, therapist, or other licensed
practitioner operating within the scope of their licensure;
• Supported as medically necessary by the utilization of other services to treat the illness
or health condition; and
• Represented by an appropriate diagnosis and CPT® or HCPCS code.
All claims for services approved under EPSDT must have the EP modifier on the claim line.
6.9.1. EPSDT and Waiver Services
Adult participants under the age of twenty-one (21) on a waiver have the same access to
Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services as a non-waiver
participant. Some waiver services are covered under the State Plan for these participants with
increased access under EPSDT as described in the service description on the waiver. Services
are considered for coverage under both EPSDT and their waiver when authorized by the
Department. Support type services are not covered under EPSDT as they fail to meet the
requirement for a 1905(a) service. Any service provided under EPSDT will not impact a
participant’s budget or share of cost.
6.9.2. EPSDT Request Procedure
See the subsection below for the request procedure for services under State Plan, outside of
State Plan, outpatient behavioral health and dental services. The parent, guardian or
participant receives a Notice of Decision from the Department or their designee informing
them whether the request was approved or denied. The Notice of Decision may also list
alternative services that are available. If the request is denied, the parent, guardian or
participant, if over eighteen (18), may appeal the decision. Instructions for appeals are on
the Notice of Decision.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
a) Request Procedure: Services Under State Plan
Services that require a prior authorization are considered under Early and Periodic Screening,
Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) during the prior authorization process. However, if a
service does not usually require a prior authorization, a request can be submitted with a note
on the coversheet requesting a review under EPSDT and the reason for the request (e.g., for
not meeting criteria, over limitations, etc.). Prior authorization requests without a legitimate
cause are returned unreviewed. Services covered under the State Plan should be requested
through the service’s normal request channel with all regularly required documentation (e.g.,
durable medical equipment through the Medical Care Unit). Requests are usually completed
in fifteen (15) business days or less.
b) Request Procedure: Services Not in State Plan
When a participant requires services not covered under the State Plan, an EPSDT Request
Form must be submitted to the Department for prior authorization. All services under Early
and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) must fall into a category of service
listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, be considered safe, effective, and meet acceptable
standards of medical practice.
The EPSDT Request Form must be completed and signed by a competent participant over age
eighteen (18) or by their parent or guardian. All requests must be submitted with supporting
documentation and an order from a physician or non-physician practitioner which may require
coordination with other providers to obtain. Services not under State Plan may take longer to
review when:
• A new provider must be secured to perform the treatment;
• Additional documentation is needed to determine medical necessity;
• Providers fail to submit requested materials in a timely manner;
• Research is necessary to determine impacts to care; or
• The case is particularly complex and requires coordination between multiple agencies
and providers to guarantee appropriate care.
For other questions, or general information, please email requests
to EPSDTrequest@dhw.idaho.gov.
c) Request Procedure: Outpatient Behavioral Health
Community-based mental health services are provided under the Idaho Behavioral Health
Plan by Magellan Healthcare Inc’s provider network. Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic
and Treatment (EPSDT) requests for community-based mental health services must be
completed on the Magellan Healthcare Inc’s Idaho EPSDT Form. For more information contact
Magellan Healthcare, Inc. by calling 1-855-202-0973 or visit the Magellan website.
d) Request Procedure: Dental Services
Preventive and restorative dental services are provided under the Idaho Smiles plan by
Managed Care of North America’s (MCNA) provider network. Early and Periodic Screening,
Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) requests for dental services must be designated on the
MCNA prior authorization form. For more information or the prior authorization form contact
Idaho Smiles by calling 1-855-233-6262 or visit MCNA Dental’s website.

6.10. Incarcerated Persons
Medicaid reimbursement is not available for inmates of government jails, tribal jails or prison
facilities, unless the inmate, the medical institution and the services rendered meet all the
provisions for reimbursement as provided within the “Reimbursement Policy Change for
Individuals who are Incarcerated (Residents) of Correctional Facilities (Public Institutions)
within Idaho”.
Inmates of a public institution operated under the authority of the State of Idaho, or its
political subdivision, may be eligible for select Medicaid benefits in a hospital, freestanding
psychiatric hospital, or institution for mental disease enrolled with Idaho Medicaid and open
to the public. Inmates must otherwise be eligible for Medicaid and have an inpatient status of
a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. Healthcare services provided to residents of Idaho
eligible for Idaho Medicaid and who are residing in Public Institutions outside of the territorial
boundaries of the State of Idaho are excluded from reimbursement under this policy and are
the responsibility of the Public Institution with authority over that individual.
When all provisions are met, the applicant’s incarceration status no longer disqualifies
providers from receiving Medicaid reimbursement. Applicants without Medicaid may be
evaluated for eligibility as if they were not incarcerated. Providers should come to an
agreement with the Public Institution responsible for the individual to determine which entity
will apply for Medicaid on the applicant’s behalf when they meet these requirements.
Eligibility for incarcerated participants is available retroactively. Medicaid coverage begins the
day the inmate is admitted into the medical institution and ends the day of discharge.
However, incarcerated participants do not have the same benefits as other participants. Only
these services are covered for inmates, and only when all other Idaho Medicaid requirements
for the service are fulfilled:
• Inpatient room and board;
• Ancillary services directly related to the inpatient stay; and
• Emergency transportation services for transfers occurring after inpatient status has
been determined and only when directly between hospitals, freestanding psychiatric
hospitals and institutions for mental diseases providing continued inpatient treatment.
6.10.1. Incarcerated Persons: Third-Party Liability
In addition to all regular third-party liability requirements in the General Billing Instructions,
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, healthcare services related to the negligent acts of a third-
party, including correctional institutions or law enforcement agencies, are their responsibility.
Non-covered and excluded services are the responsibility of the Public Institution with custody
of the inmate. This includes any service not mentioned in the section above and expenses
related to law enforcement personnel or security.

6.11. Katie Beckett Medicaid Eligibility
Katie Beckett Medicaid, also known as Home Care for Certain Disabled Children (HCCDC),
enables children under the age of nineteen (19) with special health care needs and/or
disabilities to receive care at home instead of in an institution. Eligibility for Medicaid is based
on the disabled child’s income and assets excluding the income of their parents or guardians.
The cost of care at home is compared to the cost of institutionalization when determining
eligibility. Once approved for Medicaid, participants are eligible to receive all the benefits on
the Enhanced Plan. In the event that a participant becomes institutionalized, the family should
contact Self Reliance to update their eligibility.
Katie Beckett participants are subject to copayments and premiums as these are based on
the household’s income, which is above 133% of the federal poverty limit (FPL). Participants
with a household income under 133% are eligible for other Medicaid eligibility.

6.12. Managed Care Programs for Dual Eligible Participants
The Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus) plan and Medicare Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP) are
managed care service delivery program options for dual eligible participants. The purpose of
these plans is to integrate care for individuals who are currently served by both Medicare and
Medicaid and meet certain eligibility requirements. These programs are designed to
coordinate delivery of primary, preventive, acute, behavioral, and long-term care services
and supports.
Participants continue to use their Medicaid ID (MID) numbers as established under the
Participant Eligibility and Benefit Plan Coverage section. Participating Medicare Advantage
Plans offering MMCP programs also issue a plan identification number specific to their
company and a provide participants an identification card incorporating their Medicare and
Medicaid benefits.
6.12.1. Idaho Medicaid Plus (IMPlus)
Participants who are 21 years old or older, enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B, eligible
for full Medicaid, who reside in an IMPlus coverage area, who do not voluntarily enroll in
MMCP, and who are not in an excluded or exempt population are required to enroll in IMPlus.
Participants who do not make an active selection of a health plan to administer their IMPlus
coverage are automatically enrolled in IMPlus and auto-assigned to a participating health plan.
6.12.2. Medicare-Medicaid Coordinated Plan (MMCP)
Participants who are 21 years old or older, enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, eligible for
full Medicaid, and reside in an MMCP coverage area are eligible to voluntarily enroll in MMCP
through an MMCP health plan.

6.13. Medicare Coinsurance & Deductible
These are participants with eligibility under Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)/Medicare
Coinsurance. This coverage pays for the participant’s Medicare Part B Premium, and any
coinsurance and deductible amounts for Medicare-covered services. These participants are
not eligible for Medicaid benefits, only Medicare coverage. See the General Billing Instructions,
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information on third-party liability and Medicaid
participants with Medicare.

6.16. Medicare Savings Program
The Department has agreements with the Social Security Administration and Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which allows the state to enroll people in the Premium
Hospital Insurance Program (also referred to as Premium HI or Medicare Part A) and
Supplementary Medical Insurance (also referred to as SMI or Medicare Part B). The
agreements allow Medicaid participants entitled to Medicare to have their Part A and/or Part
B Medicare premiums paid by Medicaid. Participants do not have to be 65 years old or older
to be eligible for Medicare. See the subsections below for the different kinds of Part A and
Part B Medicare Savings Programs.
See the “Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) Medicare/Medicaid Billing Information”
subsection of the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, for more
information.
6.16.1. Part A Medicare Savings Programs
There are two types of Part A Medicare Savings Programs:
• Regular Type Part A; and
• Qualified Disabled Working Individual (QDWI) Part A
The Regular Type Part A Medicare Savings Program is for individuals not entitled to premium-
free Medicare Part A benefits. These individuals must apply for Medicare with the Social
Security Administration and be determined eligible for self-pay type Medicare. These
individuals have a Medicare claim number with a Beneficiary Identification Code (BIC) of M.
This code is found at the end of the Medicare claim number.
The Qualified Disabled Working Individual (QDWI) Part A Medicare Savings Program is for
individuals that have lost Medicare Part A (HI) entitlement solely because of work and are
entitled to enroll in Part A Medicare under §1818A of the Social Security Act. The Qualified
Disabled Working Individual Program does not include state payment of Part B Medicare
premiums.

6.16.3. Dually Eligible Medicare Beneficiaries
Individuals that are enrolled in Medicare, and eligible for Medicaid benefits, are considered
dually eligible participants. Dually eligible participants receive Medicare Part A and/or Part B
premium coverage, and coinsurance and deductible reimbursement consideration for
Medicare covered services. Pharmacy items or other services not covered by the dually eligible
participant’s Medicare benefits may be covered under the participant’s Medicaid benefits.
6.16.4. Medicare Part D
Under the Medicare Modernization Act, dually eligible individuals no longer receive their drug
coverage from Medicaid and instead select or are automatically enrolled into private Medicare
prescription drug plans. Medicaid may still cover certain essential drugs excluded by law from
the Medicare Part D, Prescription Drug Program. Medicare must be billed prior to submitting
drug claims to Medicaid. If the Medicare Explanation of Benefits (EOB) indicates that the
requested medication is one of the medications not covered by law, then Medicaid may
reimburse.

6.17. Otherwise Ineligible Non-citizens
Individuals who do not meet the citizenship or qualified non-citizen requirements may be
eligible for medical services necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. An
emergency medical condition exists when the condition could reasonably be expected to
seriously harm the person’s health, cause serious impairment to bodily functions, or cause
serious dysfunction to any body part or organ, without immediate medical attention. Childbirth
qualifies as an emergency, but ante and postpartum services do not. Medicaid eligibility for
otherwise ineligible non-citizens (OINC) begins no earlier than the date the participant
experiences the medical emergency and ends the date the emergency condition stops. The
Quality Improvement Organization, Telligen, makes determinations on the appropriate length
of stay during the eligibility review process.
6.17.1. Applying for Eligibility
The general application used to apply for Medicaid is also used for OINC applicants.
Applications should be submitted after the emergency condition has ended. Hospitals may
attach medical records with applications if they are helping the applicant apply for assistance.
Completed applications are submitted to:
Self-Reliance Program
PO Box 83720
Boise, ID 83720-0026
The Quality Improvement Organization, Telligen, Inc., determines whether the services are
necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition or qualify as services for
pregnant women.
6.17.2. Citizens
Services requiring a prior authorization should be submitted to the designated reviewer for
that service after the participant is approved for eligibility. Providers should note on the prior
authorization request that a retrospective review is being requested for a participant with
retroactive eligibility. A prior authorization for length of stay is not necessary.

6.18. The Pregnant Women Program
The Pregnant Women (PW) program was developed to provide medical assistance to
encourage women to seek prenatal care early in a pregnancy and preserve the health of both
mother and infant. The program assists Idaho residents with a verified pregnancy not
currently receiving medical assistance from the state or county, and without sufficient
resources for private medical coverage. Women found eligible under the PW program have
the same coverage as participants on the Medicaid Basic Plan. Coverage through the program
continues for twelve (12) months after the end of the pregnancy, and extends until the last
day of the twelfth (12th) month. Women on the PW program are evaluated for other Medicaid
eligibility at the end of their coverage.
6.18.1. Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women
Presumptive eligibility (PE) for pregnant women is designed to provide participants prenatal
care between being diagnosed pregnant and receiving an eligibility determination. PE for
pregnant women only covers outpatient prenatal care and not deliveries, miscarriages, or
abortions. Medical coverage for the PW Program during the PE period is restricted to
ambulatory outpatient, pregnancy-related services only. Pregnancy-related services may be
rendered by any qualified Medicaid provider.
Routine prenatal services are covered, as well as some additional services such as nutrition
counseling, risk-reduction follow-up, and social service counseling. Providers are not required
to bill another insurance resource, if it exists, before billing Medicaid for prenatal services
during the PE period.
The PE Program does not cover PW inpatient services. Medicaid does not pay for any type of
abortion for women on the PE Program. Also, women with PE are not covered for any delivery
services. Services not covered under Medicaid are the participant’s responsibility. If the
woman with PE has applied for the PW Program or any other Medicaid program, and is
determined eligible, hospital inpatient services may be covered.

6.19. Refugee Medical Assistance Program
The Refugee Medical Assistance Program provides eligibility to certain refugees who are not
otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Coverage is limited to eight months, beginning when
the refugee arrives in the United States. Children born to the refugee during that time period
are also eligible for the Refugee Medical Assistance Program, but only as long as their parent’s
coverage remains in effect. At the conclusion of the program’s coverage, participants will be
evaluated for coverage under other eligibility programs.
In order to qualify for Medicaid eligibility through the Refugee Medical Assistance Program,
the applicant must:
• Meet the federal definition of refugee for the purposes of the program;
• Not be otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP; and
• Have an income under 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL).
Refugees whose income exceeds 150% of the FPL may still be eligible under a special “spend
down” consideration if the remainder of their income after medical expenses are deducted
drops their income below 150% of the FPL.
Coverage under the Refugee Medical Assistance Program is contingent on Idaho’s receipt of
federal funding. In the event that funds are not received, this program will be suspended
without advance notice.

6.20. Youth Empowerment Services (YES)
The Medicaid Youth Empowerment Services (YES) Program provides a doorway to Medicaid
eligibility for children under the age of eighteen (18) with a serious emotional disturbance
(SED). Once approved for Medicaid, participants are eligible for all benefits on the Enhanced
Plan, plus respite care through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan (IBHP) and person-centered
service planning. The participant must complete an assessment and update the person-
centered service plan at least every 12 months, and utilize Medicaid-paid respite services
through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan to maintain eligibility under the program.
In order to qualify for Medicaid eligibility through the Medicaid YES Program, the applicant
must:
• Have a verified SED and functional impairment;
• Have an income under 300% of the federal poverty level (FPL);
• Be under the age of eighteen (18);
• Be an Idaho resident;
• Be a U.S. citizen or meet requirements for legal noncitizen;
• Cooperate with obtaining a medical support order for a non-custodial parent unless
good cause can be established;
• Not reside in an ineligible institution; and
• Not be fleeing prosecution of a felony, custody, or confinement of a felony conviction
or violating a condition of probation or parole.
A serious emotional disturbance is defined as a diagnosable mental health, emotional or
behavioral disorder, or a neuropsychiatric condition which results in a serious disability
and which causes a functional impairment. The diagnosis must be made in alignment with
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). A disability caused by
the diagnosis is considered serious if it causes a substantial impairment of thought,
perception, affect or behavior in family, school or community settings, and requires
sustained treatment interventions. A substance use disorder does not, by itself, constitute
a serious emotional disturbance, although it may coexist with serious emotional
disturbance.
The SED must be verified by Medicaid’s Independent Assessment contractor (Liberty
Healthcare) using a Comprehensive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA) and the Child and
Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) functional assessment tool. Liberty Healthcare
completes the CDA and CANS in the applicant’s home and contact them within one business
day with the results and next steps. These assessments are provided at no cost to the family
or applicant seeking eligibility. A CDA completed by another provider may be used if it was
completed in the last six (6) months.
Providers can direct potential applicants to contact Liberty Healthcare at 1 (877) 305-3469
for the free assessment. Other services may be available for children with an SED who do not
meet the additional requirements for Medicaid eligibility; e.g., family income exceeding 300%
FPL. See the Youth Empowerment Services website or contact Magellan Healthcare for more
information on getting services for youth without Medicaid.

7. Healthy Connections (HC)
Healthy Connections (HC) is the Idaho Medicaid primary care program in which a primary
care provider or team provides comprehensive and continuous medical care to a participant
with the goal of improving health outcomes. Our mission is to ensure Medicaid participants
receive the care they need, when they need it, and in the appropriate setting. The Healthy
Connections program is structured to incentivize HC providers to transform to the Patient
Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care whereby a participant’s treatment is
coordinated through their primary care provider and their team, which can include
organizations, hospitals or other entities.
The goals of HC are to:
• Ensure access to healthcare;
• Improve the quality of healthcare and overall well-being of Medicaid participants;
• Emphasize care coordination and continuity of care;
• Encourage participants to be involved in their healthcare decisions; and
• Achieve cost efficiencies for the Idaho Medicaid Program.
Medicaid participant enrollment into HC is required in the majority of counties statewide.
Individuals qualifying for Idaho Medicaid will receive correspondence requesting they identify
their current Primary Care Provider (PCP) or choose an HC clinic.
July 1, 2025 Page 96 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
7.1. Healthy Connections Provider Enrollment
Idaho Medicaid primary care providers participate in Healthy Connections by signing a
Coordinated Care Provider Agreement in addition to the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement.
Coordinated Care Provider Agreements are available from the Regional Healthy Connections
Representatives. Addresses and telephone numbers for the regional HC offices are listed in
the Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, and at the Manage my Medicaid with
Healthy Connections website.
What is a primary care provider? An MD, DO, PA, Nurse Practitioner, etc., who participates
in the Healthy Connections program with a contracted organization to coordinate and monitor
primary care services.
What are primary care services? Services including preventive services, diagnosis and
treatment of acute injury and sickness, and management of long-term conditions.
In the Healthy Connections (HC) Program, Primary Care Providers qualify for tiers and are
incentivized to implement a Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care and
improve participant outcomes. HC service locations offering enhanced participant care and
PCMH characteristics may qualify for higher tier placement. Upon approval of tier placement,
the HC service location is issued an HC Coordinated Care Agreement Addendum which outlines
requirements to maintain tier status and monthly primary care case management fee.
Providers are required to keep their record current and notify Gainwell Technologies of any
changes in their record to ensure accurate participant enrollment in Healthy Connections,
including:
• Enroll all rendering PCPs and each HC service location in the MMIS system for the
purposes of assigning participants at the location where they receive primary care
services.
• Keep all of the provider enrollment information current in the MMIS system by
completing any maintenance items within 28 days of the change as required in the
Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement.
• Updated provider record information will be acted on once submitted and approved
through the provider enrollment application in HealthPAS.
The HC Service Location information (i.e. name and demographics) entered in the Gainwell
Technology system will appear on the following:
• HC Network Directory (HC website)
• HC Rosters (Gainwell system)
o Online dynamic roster (PCP Roster)
o HC monthly Case Management report (Gainwell system - file exchange)
• Verifying participant eligibility (Gainwell system)
o Includes clinic name and office hours
• HC Referral lookup (Gainwell system)
• HC enrollment participant letters
o Clinic name and demographics

7.1.6. Healthy Connections Corrective Action Process
(CAP)
When Idaho Medicaid becomes aware that a clinic is out of compliance for one of the Tier
requirements, the corrective action process will begin. If compliance is not met within the
timeframe outlined below, the outcome could include one of the following: Regression of tier,
Case management suspension, or Termination as a Healthy Connections provider.
Corrective action steps:
Step One: Clinic will be contacted verbally to discuss the non-compliance and possible
solution. Clinic will be given fifteen (15) business days to correct the non-compliance issue.
Step Two: At day sixteen (16), if compliance is not met, a formal corrective action letter will
be emailed to the clinic contact that has been established at first contact. Clinic will have an
additional fifteen (15) business days to correct the non-compliance issue.
Step Three: At day thirty-one (31), if compliance is not met, a second formal corrective
action letter will be emailed and mailed certified, return receipt. Clinic will have an additional
fifteen (15) days to correct the non-compliance issue.
Step Four: After the forty-five (45) days have expired:
• If non-compliance is for 24/7 requirement, clinic will be termed as a Healthy
Connections provider, and a letter will be mailed, certified, return receipt.
• If non-compliance is for other Tier requirements, clinic will be regressed to appropriate
tier (example Tier 3 to Tier 2). A formal letter will be mailed, certified, return receipt.
If regression occurs, clinic can apply for higher Tier once compliance has been met.
7.1.7. Healthy Connections Case Management Payment
In addition to payment for services rendered, Healthy Connections (HC) clinics are paid a
monthly case management fee. The monthly case management fee is paid for every
participant enrolled with the HC clinic on the first day of each month. The case management
payment is based on the tier level of the HC clinic as of the first of the month.
The case management payment is generally processed on the Tuesday of the first full week
of the month. The monthly Healthy Connections roster reports are then available following
the processing of the case management payment.
HC clinics qualify for one of the following three tiers of reimbursement for all enrolled
participants:
Healthy
Healthy
Healthy
Connections
Connections
Medicaid Plan
Connections
Care
Medical Home
Tier I
Management
Tier III
Tier II
All Enrolled participants $3.00 $7.00 $9.50
7.1.8. Healthy Connections Participant Rosters
The following two Primary Care rosters are available to PCPs.
July 1, 2025 Page 103 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
• An online, dynamic Primary Care Roster is available on the Gainwell Technologies
Medicaid website through your Trading Partner Account and is called the PCP Roster.
This is a list of currently enrolled HC participants and the PCP is able to verify eligibility
or issue a referral from this roster. This roster can be exported to either Excel format
or in PDF form. The contact information on the exportable report can be used to contact
participants and encourage them to be engaged in their healthcare.
o To further support HC providers in coordinating their patient care, the following
are some of the fields included on the exportable Excel or PDF list of
participants:
▪ Participant name;
▪ Phone Number;
▪ Address;
▪ Head of Household; and
▪ Enrollment Indicator (Mandatory or Voluntary enrollment).
• The Monthly Healthy Connections Roster report is a list of participants enrolled to a
Healthy Connections service location effective the first day of the month, and includes
case management payment information. The report is divided in to four sections: new
enrollees, ongoing enrollees, lost eligibility, and dis-enrollees. This serves as the HC
Case Management Payment report. This monthly roster is uploaded to the
Organization’s secure portal under the File Exchange ‘Reports’ section and is available
in both PDF and Excel formats.
An announcement will be posted to the Gainwell Technologies Health PAS website when the
rosters become available.
July 1, 2025 Page 104 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
7.2. Participant Enrollment
Medicaid providers should always verify participant eligibility and Healthy Connections (HC)
enrollment prior to rendering services, as described in the Verifying Participant Eligibility
section. For participants enrolled in Healthy Connections, the PCP information will be provided
through the automated and/or online system. If an HC PCP is not indicated, an HC referral is
not required.
Enrollment in HC is mandatory for most Medicaid participants and required in the majority of
counties statewide. Participants not enrolled in HC are mailed an enrollment form and given
up to 90 days to inform us of their choice of PCP. When a Medicaid participant does not choose
a PCP and they live in a mandatory county, the participant is assigned to an HC PCP.
HC clinics are required to absorb any participant enrolled to their clinic even if a specific
provider is no longer with that HC clinic. If the clinic does not have the capacity to absorb
those participants, they must change their panel to “Not Accepting New Medicaid”.
7.2.1. Voluntary Participant Enrollment in Healthy
Connections
Participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections (HC) and without an exception, can complete
an enrollment form at an HC clinic and fax it to 1 (888) 532-0014 or e-mail to
HCCR7@dhw.idaho.gov. Assisting participants to enroll to an HC clinic will help avoid the
possibility of assignment to a different HC clinic.
7.2.2. Participant Enrollment Guidelines
• Enrollment in HC is mandatory for most Medicaid participants.
• Enrollment requests must be submitted by the participant or an authorized
representative.
• Enrollment to the HC clinic will be effective the date the enrollment request is
approved.
• Each enrolled participant is sent a written notice listing the name, phone number, and
address of their HC clinic. This notice is generated and mailed the day after the
participant’s enrollment is entered.
• Family participants are not required to choose the same HC clinic.
• Medicaid participants may enroll to an HC clinic in one of the following ways.
o Preferred method – Enroll online on the Manage my Medicaid with Healthy
Connections website, choosing the blue link “Find a Healthy Connections PCP”.
o Complete and return an HC Enrollment form received in the mail;
o Complete enrollment form at clinic and have it faxed to the Healthy Connections
Consolidated Unit at 1 (888) 532-0014; or
o Call the HC Consolidated Unit at 1 (888) 528-5861 to enroll over the phone
• Clinic is required to absorb any participants enrolled to their clinic even if a specific
provider is no longer with the HC clinic.
• The HC Network Directory can be found on the Find a Healthy Connections Primary
Care Provider website.
7.2.3. Enrollment to clinic with panel limitations
Healthy Connections (HC) clinics have the option to request a closed panel and not accept
new Medicaid participants or request panel limitations for enrollment. Limited or closed panel
clinics may arrange with HC to process enrollments without prior approval when any of the
following conditions are met:
o Participants are currently established as shown by claims within last 12 months.
o Participants have an upcoming scheduled appointment or recent appointment.
July 1, 2025 Page 105 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
o Participants with family members currently established.
If the above conditions are not met, or the clinic is closed to new Medicaid, participants will
be directed to the clinic for enrollment approval. The clinic must contact Healthy Connections
with the approval for the participant to be enrolled in one of the following ways:
• Enrollment form from the clinic, signed by the participant or their authorized
representative.
• Phone call from clinic validating enrollment request received from participant.
It is the responsibility of the organization to communicate panel limitations to all locations
participating in Healthy Connections.
7.2.4. Mandatory Participant Enrollment in Healthy
Connections
If a primary care provider (PCP)/clinic chooses to accept mandatory assignment participants,
the assignments will occur within the panel limits the PCP/clinic has provided to Healthy
Connections (HC) (i.e., accepting new Medicaid, age limits, etc.).
The requirements for assignments are as follows:
• When a participant is assigned to PCP/clinic, the clinic is required to allow assigned
participant(s) to establish care, even if the panel subsequently has closed to accepting
mandatory assignments; and
• If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, PCP/clinic
is required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant or
providing a one-time referral.
• If the clinic cannot absorb patients due to a provider leaving the location, or assigned
participants cannot access care timely, the clinic must set their panel limits to “Not
Accepting New Medicaid”, and change their panel limits to not accepting mandatory
assignments.
It is recommended that PCP/clinics check the Healthy Connections roster each month to see
list of newly assigned participants and conduct outreach to encourage establishing care.
Participants not submitting a choice of provider will be assigned to an HC clinic up to 90-days
after eligibility, to be effective the first of the following month, based on the following criteria:
• Assign participants to a clinic where they are currently receiving care.
• Assign family members to a clinic where other family members are enrolled, if
appropriate.
• Assign participants to a prior Healthy Connections clinic, when applicable.
• Assign participants to a clinic based on geographic location.
• Assign participants based on rotation schedule agreed upon by clinic.
7.2.5. Changing Enrollment in Healthy Connections
Healthy Connections participants will be enrolled based on a fixed enrollment process. A set
period of time is designated during the year when participants are allowed to change their
PCP without cause. This is commonly known as the “annual enrollment period”. Fixed
enrollment encourages a long-term provider-patient relationship resulting in the participant
receiving a consistent source of care, provides for better patient outcomes and supports the
value-based model of care.
Changes in enrollment are to be submitted by the participant or an authorized representative.
HC clinics may submit HC enrollment forms on behalf of a participant, as long as the
enrollment form is completed and signed by the participant or an authorized representative.
July 1, 2025 Page 106 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
Participants or their authorized representatives are allowed to initiate a change for any
reason:
• During the annual enrollment period of July and August;
• Within the first ninety (90) days of enrollment with a new HC service location/clinic;
• Due to automatic re-enrollment and the participant misses any part of the annual open
enrollment period; or
• To request a different service location/clinic within the HC Organization (same Tax ID).
Participants will remain enrolled with their primary care provider unless they qualify for a
change. To see if a participant qualifies to change their provider, have them contact Healthy
Connections. Some reasons for change include:
• Participant requests different PCP than one assigned by the Department;
• Participant moved outside of the PCP’s service area;
• Participant requests different PCP to allow members of a household to be enrolled with
the same PCP (one medical home);
• Participant requests change due to changing to/from a specialty provider (i.e.,
Pediatrics, etc.);
• Participant chooses to follow PCP to a different HC organization, to maintain the
existing relationship with the PCP; or
• Other reasons determined to be acceptable by the Department.
Requests to change providers will be verified and approved if they meet Fixed Enrollment
criteria. A request to change is not guaranteed and may not be acted on immediately. As a
result, it is important for providers to obtain referrals from the provider of record in the system
prior to rendering services.
Failure to adhere to these policies may result in investigation by the Medicaid
Program Integrity Unit.

7.2.6. Exceptions & Exemptions to HC Enrollment
Participants meeting the exception or exemption criteria in this section are not required to
enroll in the Healthy Connections Program. A referral is not needed for services rendered to
participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections.
Participants are not required to enroll in Healthy Connections who meet the following
exception criteria:
• The participant has an eligibility period that is less than three (3) months;
• The participant has an eligibility period that is only retroactive;
• The participant only has Qualified Medicare Beneficiary eligibility;
• The participant is enrolled in one of the managed care programs for Dual Eligible
participants;
• The participant resides in long-term care or ICF/IID facility; or
July 1, 2025 Page 107 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
• The participant resides in a non-mandatory county where there are not adequate
numbers of providers to deliver primary care case management services.
Participants may opt out of Healthy Connections by requesting and qualifying for one of the
following exemption reasons:
• Participant is unable to access a Healthy Connections provider within a distance of
thirty (30) miles or within thirty (30) minutes to obtain primary care services;
• Participant has an existing relationship with a primary care provider or clinic (currently
under the care) who is not participating in Healthy Connections or is a Health Home
provider. However, once the participant chooses to enroll with or receive services from
an HC clinic, the participant no longer qualifies for an exemption (verified annually);
• Participant has Medicare as their primary healthcare plan;
• Participant is a member of a federally recognized tribe; or
• Participant is under 19 years of age and is:
o Eligible for SSI under Title XVI;
o Eligible under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act, qualified disabled children; or
o Receiving foster care or adoption assistance.
Exempted participants not enrolled in Healthy Connections will appear as “Exempt from
Healthy Connections” when checking eligibility. At any time, a participant with an exemption,
but not an exception, may opt to enroll with a Healthy Connections provider.
7.2.7. Participant Disenrollment by the Provider
A PCP may choose to withdraw as the participant’s primary care provider and must give
written notice to both the participant and the Department at least (30) days prior to the date
of disenrollment. Failure by the PCP to notify Healthy Connections will result in continued
obligation to provide care and/or referrals until notice is received. The Department may waive
this notice on a case-by-case basis. The written notice from the PCP must give the enrollee
the reason for the request for disenrollment.
A PCP may request disenrollment of a participant because:
• Participant has been previously discharged from the practice – PCP to provide copy of
dismissal notice sent to participant
• A documented, ongoing pattern of failure on the part of the participant to keep
scheduled appointments
• A documented situation where there is an inability by the PCP, after making a
reasonable effort to maintain a mutually satisfactory PCP/participant relationship
• Behavior of the participant that is disruptive or abusive (and not related to his/her
special needs) to the extent that the PCP’s ability to furnish services to the participant
or other participants is impaired.
A PCP may not request disenrollment because of:
• An adverse change in the participant’s health status
• The participant’s over/under utilization of medical services
• The participant’s diminished mental capacity
• The participant’s uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or her special
needs (except when his or her continued enrollment seriously impairs a PCP’s ability
to furnish services to the participant of other participants)
Upon the reassignment of the participant to a new PCP, the former PCP must transfer a copy
of the participant’s medical records to the new PCP when requested by the participant.
July 1, 2025 Page 108 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
7.3. Referrals
A referral is a documented communication from a participant’s PCP of record to another
Medicaid provider for a specific covered service. The participant’s HC clinic is responsible for
providing primary care, managing the participant’s care and making referrals for medically
necessary services. The PCP plays a key role in linking participants with community
resources to facilitate referrals and respond to the participant’s medical and social needs.
7.3.1. Important Referral Policy Reminders
• Referrals must always be received prior to delivery of care.
• Backdated or retroactive referrals are not acceptable. Any service provided with a
backdated or retroactive referral is considered to be non-covered and may be
subject to recoupment and civil monetary penalties.
• Referral requirements apply regardless of Medicare or other insurance coverage.
• The referral must be documented in the records of both the referring and receiving
providers to be valid.
• Referrals entered online in the HealthPAS portal meet the referral documentation
requirements.
• Once received a referral remains active even if the participant changes their
enrollment with an HC clinic.
• Providers receiving referrals may also forward the referral to another Medicaid
provider as long as the date and scope of the referral meets the condition stated
in the original referral.
• The referral requirement for primary care services accessed between HC clinics
affiliated either by the same NPI, Tax ID or Provider Network owned by the same
organization (not VCO affiliation) is at the discretion of the HC clinic/organization
of record.
• Referral authority may be externally delegated to an “outside organization” for the
purposes of care coverage. However, externally delegated referral authority must
be documented in the covering HC service location for the specific visit.
• In the event that a service not requiring a referral begins and must be changed to
a service that requires a referral, one is not required. However, the medical
documentation must support the service change.
• Referrals cannot be accepted in lieu of a prior authorization. PA’s are for certain
services that require review and approval prior to being provided.
• When verifying eligibility, if no HC clinic is indicated or “Exempt from Healthy
Connections” is returned, no referral is required.
• If a participant has not established care, and has an urgent medical need, clinic is
required to provide “timely access to care” either by seeing the participant or
providing a one-time referral and working with participant to schedule an
appointment.
• Healthy Connections enrolls to the clinic, not a specific provider. Any HC provider
that participates and provides primary care can authorize a referral for any enrolled
participant.
• Historical note: In March 2020, referral requirements were suspended due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Effective July 1, 2021, referral requirements were reinstated.
7.3.2. Referral Elements
Effective 2/1/2016, the following are the required core referral elements:
• Date issued;
• Name of HC PCP or clinic issuing referral;
• Participant information;
July 1, 2025 Page 109 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
• Referred-to provider (suggest obtaining billing organization NPI to find accurate
location in system);
• Start and end date of the referral (not to exceed one year);
• Diagnosis and/or Condition (entered in Notes section in HealthPAS); and
• Referral reason:
o Consultation/diagnosis only;
o Diagnose, treat, and/or forward to specialty provider;
o One time visit until seen by PCP; and
o Any additional referral limits or restrictions.
7.3.3. Method of Referral
A referral must be communicated by one of the following methods:
• Electronic referral (e.g., Gainwell Technologies HealthPAS portal or HC clinic
electronic Medical Record {EMR});
• Paper referral (e.g., HC Referral form, prescription pad, etc.);
• Verbal Referral (e.g., calling an order into a specialist); or
• Admit Order (e.g., hospital direct admit by participant’s HC clinic PCP).
7.3.4. Advantages of Electronic Referrals
There are many advantages to submitting an online electronic referral, including:
• Improved Accessibility and Communication of Data - The PCP, referred-to-
provider and Department staff can access the referral online anytime;
• Enhanced Capacity – Resource for PCP to provide better coordinated care by having
access to participant referrals entered online;
• Integrity - Authorized visits and/or date span of specified services are clear and
concise;
• Secure - HIPAA compliant referral process; and
• Timesaver - No handling or storage of a paper referral.
Refer to the Referrals section of the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide found in the
User Guides under the Reference Material menu on the Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid
website for instructions to enter or retrieve online referrals.
7.3.5. Follow-up Communication Requirements for
Referrals
Providers who receive Healthy Connections referrals must communicate their assessment,
recommendations, or progress back to the HC PCP of record within a timely manner. Services
provided for an extended period shall be reported to the PCP with an annual report, or more
frequently if significant changes occur in the patient’s overall health. Failure to communicate
findings to the PCP may result in services being considered non-covered and subject to
recoupment.
7.3.6. Services Not Requiring an HC PCP Referral
The following services do not require a referral by the Healthy Connections Primary Care
Provider. If the service is not on this list, it may require a referral. Services are hyperlinked
where applicable to direct providers to the appropriate section of the Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbook or program website. Services must meet the requirements below and the definition
of the service category to qualify.

7.3.7. Reimbursement for Services Requiring a Referral
It is the responsibility of the billing provider to ensure a referral is documented and meets the
requirements outlined in the Provider Handbook prior to rendering services. Claims will
process regardless of referral status. The referral field in the claims processing system is a
misnomer and is intended for prior authorization numbers. Entering a referral number on the
claim will cause the claim to deny. Services provided and billed to Medicaid without a referral,
when one is required, are subject to sanctions, recoupment or both. Billing Medicaid for
services without a correct and complete referral is not allowed. Any payments received as a
result of a missing or incomplete referral are subject to recoupment and/or assessment of
civil monetary penalties by the Department.
See the Participant Financial Responsibility section for more information about when billing
participants is permissible.
7.3.8. School Based Health Centers
A School Based Health Center (SBHC) is defined as a health center located at an elementary,
middle, or high school. College health services do not qualify as an SBHC. SBHCs do not
require a referral for acute care services provided to a student so long as all requirements
of this section are met:
July 1, 2025 Page 112 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
• The participant’s PCP must be contacted within three business days with written or
electronic documentation for coordination of care.
• Documentation must include:
o A visit summary;
o Prescriptions or orders issued; and
o Any other information the PCP may need to be aware of.
• If secondary or specialty care is medically necessary, the SBHC provider will refer the
student back to their HC PCP.
• The student’s parent/guardian must be contacted with the visit outcome and any
follow-up care recommendations.
An SBHC is eligible to be a mobile unit. A provider must enroll each of the locations under
their pay-to NPI to represent which school the services would be occurring at. If a mobile
SBHC provider delivered services at a non-school location, they would need to bill a place of
service location that is equivalent to a generic mobile unit in addition to the place of service
identifier.
The SBHC will be subject to periodic evaluation of policy compliance for care coordination by
Department staff to include patient medical record reviews.

7.3.9. Urgent Care Services
Effective January 1, 2020, Healthy Connections referrals will not be required for urgent care
services accessed at urgent care centers, Health Districts or Healthy Connections Clinics that
meet the criteria below. Urgent care services for this purpose are medical services used in
the treatment of acute illness or injury which require prompt attention, but generally are not
serious enough to require an emergency room visit.
Participants are encouraged to always call their Primary Care Provider first as they may
offer same day or walk-in appointments. If their Primary Care Provider’s office is closed or
they are unable to be seen immediately for an urgent medical need, they may be seen at a
qualified Urgent Care, Health District or Healthy Connections Clinic. The Department
encourages providers to work together within their medical neighborhoods to effectively
coordinate patient care. Urgent care service providers have the option to treat participants
or contact their PCP to determine if they have availability to treat an urgent medical need.
Providers must meet all criteria listed below for urgent care services to be exempt from
referral requirements:
1. Meet the requirements for an Urgent Care facility.
2. Provide and document the follow-up communication to the patient’s Health
Connections Clinic of record.
3. Direct the patient to their Healthy Connections Clinic for any follow-up visits.
Urgent Care facility requirements:
1. Urgent Care Centers – for purposes of this referral policy, defined as:

service and the Healthy Connections clinic of record.
a. The communication requirement would be met when the urgent care service
provider and Healthy Connections Clinic of record are under the same
organization and share an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
b. Idaho Health Data Exchange (IHDE) record of visit without direct
communication to the Healthy Connections Clinic of record does not meet the
communication requirement.
2. Urgent Care Service Providers are required to, at a minimum, direct participants to
their Healthy Connections Clinic of record for follow-up visits, wellness care or
scheduled appointments.

8. Healthy Connections Value Care
The Healthy Connections Value Care (HCVC) program, started on January 1, 2022. Under this
program, Value Care Organizations (VCOs), contracted with the Department, are held
accountable for improving participant health outcomes and controlling costs. Idaho Medicaid
Healthy Connections (HC) organizations may choose to form their own VCO and contract
directly with the Department. Alternatively, they may choose to affiliate with hospitals,
primary care organizations, and other medical service organizations to form a VCO, which
then contracts with the Department. The goals of HCVC:
• Improve the health of Idahoans;
• Provide high-quality, cost effective care
• Reward organizations by sharing shared savings
New value care organization (VCO) contracts or changes in existing VCO contracts are due
annually by September 1st. Each VCO must have a minimum of 2,000 attributed participants.
VCO contracts must include Healthy Connections (HC) service locations and acute care
hospital affiliations.
An agreement between each VCO and affiliated HC organization shall be in place prior to each
performance year. This is a separate and unique agreement from the Healthy Connections
Coordinated Care Agreement. It is the responsibility of the VCO to report changes in affiliated
HC service locations to the Department.
• The VCO will inform the Department of their risk options.
• The Department will inform the VCO of their quality targets and the statewide
standardized total cost of care per member per month (PMPM) cost.
The VCO contract with the Department will renew automatically annually. For additional
information, please visit the Healthy Connections and Healthy Connections Value Care
website.

9. Covered Services and Limitations: General
Unless otherwise noted, services must be provided directly to the participant to be eligible for
reimbursement.
9.1. Medical Necessity
State Medicaid programs are mandated to only pay for medically necessary services and items
covered in Idaho Medicaid’s State Plan for adults twenty-one years of age and older. A service
or item is considered medically necessary when it is reasonably calculated to prevent,
diagnose, or treat conditions in the participant that endanger life, cause pain, cause
functionally significant deformity or malfunction. Only effective treatments that are the most
conservative (including setting, duration and frequency), or least costly, are considered
eligible. The setting a participant receives services in, and the methods or items utilized must
be safe and effective. The service or item must be of a quality that meets professionally-
recognized standards of health care and substantiated by records including evidence of such
medical necessity and quality. Items and services are not provided for the convenience of the
patient, provider or caregiver. Diagnoses on claim submissions must support medical
necessity for the services provided.
Participants under the age of 21 have an expanded definition for medical necessity to correct
or ameliorate defects, physical and mental illness, and conditions discovered by the screening
services as defined in Section 1905(r) of the SSA, whether or not such services are covered
under the State Plan. Although services under Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and
Treatment (EPSDT) are not required to be within the State Plan, they must fall into a category
of service listed in 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, be considered safe and effective, and
meet acceptable standards of medical practice. If services not covered under the State Plan
are needed, an EPSDT request form must be submitted to the Department for prior
authorization.
A service or item that has received FDA approval or its own CPT®/HCPCS code is not
automatically considered a medically necessary service or item. It must be consistent with
generally accepted professional medical standards of care and be verified through
independent study published in peer-reviewed literature before being considered for medical
necessity. In the absence of Idaho Medicaid direction for medical necessity criteria of covered
items and services, the provider should default to Medicare standards.
Screening services are generally not medically necessary. Screening is used to detect an
undiagnosed disease where early detection may prevent harm, and where the patient has no
signs, symptoms, laboratory evidence, radiological evidence or personal history of the
disease. Idaho Medicaid covers screening services as mandated by the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) and recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with an “A” or
“B” recommendation, or when listed in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Bright
Futures periodicity schedule without co-payment. When other modes of transportation are
unavailable or are not practical, Non-Emergency Transportation (NEMT) is covered for
services prior authorized as EPSDT or listed on the AAP Bright Futures periodicity schedule.
See Non-Covered and Excluded Services for information about items and services that may
not be reimbursable. See the Early & Periodic Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment (EPSDT)
section for more information and how to request services that may exceed those under State
Plan for participants under the age of 21. See www.mtm-inc.net/idaho or call 1 (877) 503-
1261 for more information.

9.2. Experimental/Investigational Services
The Department uses the terms experimental and investigational interchangeably. Services
determined to be experimental are non-covered. All services and follow-ups directly
associated with an experimental service are also excluded from reimbursement. The
Department lists services it considers experimental throughout the handbook for provider
convenience, however, on services without stated guidance from the Department providers
bear a responsibility to determine if a service meets the definition of Medical Necessity and if
it would be considered experimental. A service is experimental if:
• It is being provided as part of a phase 1 clinical trial;
• They are used to gain further evidence or knowledge;
• It tests the usefulness (i.e., efficacy) of a drug or treatment;
• There is inadequate data to provide the reasonable expectation that the service would
be as effective as the standard treatment for a condition;
o This includes category III CPT® codes and proprietary laboratory analyses (PLA)
codes.
• Expert opinion suggests additional information is needed to assess the safety or
efficacy of a treatment or procedure;
• It is determined experimental or investigational under Medicare or their local area
contractor, Noridian Healthcare; or
• It is considered investigational by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Services determined to be experimental are not eligible for coverage under Early & Periodic
Screening, Diagnostic & Treatment (EPSDT). Procedures and treatments may be eligible for
coverage with a prior authorization under a focused case review on a case-by-case basis for
participants of any age with a life threatening medical illness and no other available treatment
options. The Department may at its discretion seek an independent professional opinion if
there is insufficient information to render a coverage decision. A focused case review involves
a Department analysis of the proposed procedure or treatment and:
• The anticipated benefit and risks to the participant’s health;
• Documentation of the participant’s previous treatments and outcomes;
• Medicare’s coverage in national coverage guidelines;
• The phase of clinical trial the procedure or treatment is in (if applicable);
• Written guidance from national organizations;
• Clinical data and peer-reviewed literature;
• Ethics Committee review, if appropriate; and
• A cost-benefit analysis consisting of:
o Estimated long-term cost if the request is approved or denied; and
o Potential long-term impacts to Idaho Medicaid if the request is approved.
Requests for a focused case review are submitted to the Medical Care Unit.

modifiers Q0 and Q1 on outpatient claims to differentiate between routine and investigational
clinical services. ICD-10-CM Z00.6 must be included on the claim in the primary or secondary
position.

9.3. Qualifying Clinical Trials
The definition of a “qualifying clinical trial” is a trial related to “the prevention, detection, or
treatment of any serious or life-threatening disease or condition.” This includes a trial funded
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), or other federal-approved entities.
Routine costs are covered during a clinical trial and include any item or service provided to
“prevent, diagnose, monitor, or treat complications resulting from participation in the
qualifying clinical trial, to the extent that the provision of such items or services to the
participant would otherwise be covered outside the course of participation in the qualifying
clinical trial under the state plan or waiver. The investigational item or service that is the
subject of the clinical trial is not covered. Services not covered under the state plan or waiver
but required by the clinical trial are not covered.
Routine participant costs are covered regardless of where the clinical trial is conducted,
including out-of-state, or based on whether the principal investigator or provider treating the
participant in connection with the clinical trial is outside of the network of the participant’s
MCO. Usual requirements regarding rates, billing processes, and prior authorization for out-
of-state care, diagnostics, and interventions apply. Routine participant cost does not include
any item or service provided to the participant solely to satisfy data collection and analysis
for the qualifying clinical trial that is not used in the direct clinical management of the
participant and is not otherwise covered under the state plan or waiver.
Idaho Medicaid requests for an attestation form to be completed and faxed to the Medical
Care Unit at 877-314-8782 before participants start receiving services through a clinical trial.
The attestation form must be signed by the principal investigator (PI) or their delegated
authority (if they have a documented process for the delegation of authority) and the
participant’s health care provider that is providing the care during the trial.
Participation in a clinical trial itself does not require prior authorization (PA). However, services
associated with routine medical costs while in a clinical trial may have PA requirements that
still apply. Submit completed PA request using an Idaho Medicaid Surgery & Procedure PA
form, when required. Fax the complete form and required documentation to 877-314-8779.
For participants in an MCO, providers must follow the process required by the MCO.

9.5. Service Limitations
Service limitations restrict services based on state and federal rules and regulations. Each
procedure and revenue code may be reviewed for a variety of limitations. Limitations include,
but are not limited to:
• Services bundled when rendered by the same provider;
• Amount of services or items in a given time frame;
• Reimbursement caps during a time period;
• Medical necessity;
• Age of the participant; and
• Lifetime procedures.
Some services that exceed limitations may be covered with a prior authorization. Refer to your
specific Provider Guidelines carefully for additional information.
Policy limitations can be reviewed on request if the allowed amount doesn’t meet the average
participants’ needs. Supporting documentation should be submitted to demonstrate why the
current limitation would not meet the average participant’s medical needs. Requests may be
submitted to MCPT@dhw.idaho.gov.

9.6. Informational Codes
Services represented by informational only codes are not excluded from coverage by statute
and meet all technical requirements for coverage, but have been determined non-covered for
separate reimbursement because they are considered reimbursed in the coverage of another
procedure code.
Informational only codes do not appear on the Idaho Medicaid Fee Schedule as they are
considered non-covered services for the purposes of reimbursement. A code that is
informational only is not separately reimbursable regardless of the revenue code, CPT® or
HCPCS code selected for billing. Services coded as informational only cannot be billed under
a CPT® or HCPCS defined as unlisted or miscellaneous or billed under a revenue code that
does not require a CPT® or HCPCS. These billing practice will be subject to recoupment and
penalties. See Idaho Medicaid Claim Standards in the General Billing Instructions, Idaho
Medicaid Provider Handbook for more information about correct coding.

9.7. Non-Covered and Excluded Services
Specific non-covered services and circumstances are detailed throughout the provider
handbook. Non-covered services are not excluded from coverage by statute and meet all
technical requirements for coverage, but have been determined non-covered because of one
of the following:
• The service is not within the scope of the participant’s eligibility for coverage;
• The service requires a Healthy Connections referral and one isn’t available;
• The participant has exhausted their allowed amount;
• The service is covered in a bundle with another service, and may not be unbundled;
or
• The service is not reasonable and medically necessary. See the Medical Necessity
section for more information.
Services represented by codes not appearing on the Idaho Medicaid Fee Schedule are
considered non-covered services. Excluded services are those services that are not allowed
to be covered by state or federal statute or rule. See the List of Excluded Services section for
more information.
The following fees and situations do not fall under the Department’s definition of a non-
covered or excluded service and can never be billed to a participant:
• No-show or missed appointment fees;
• Other insurer’s co-pays;
• Failure on the part of the provider to submit a complete and correct claim to the
Department or other payor;
• Failure by the provider to submit a complete and correct request for prior authorization
from the Department or other payor;
• Claims voided by the provider;
• Failure of the provider to follow any payor’s policy or procedure; or
• Any recoupment or penalties the provider receives as a result of their action or
inaction.
A service that is non-covered or excluded is not reimbursable regardless of the revenue code,
CPT® or HCPCS code selected for billing. Non-covered or excluded services billed under a
CPT® or HCPCS defined as unlisted or miscellaneous will be subject to recoupment and
penalties. Non-covered or excluded services billed under a revenue code that does not require
a CPT® or HCPCS will also be subject to recoupment and penalties. See Idaho Medicaid Claim
Standards in the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more
information about correct coding including the requirement to bill either the GA, GX, GY or
GZ modifiers for non-covered services. See Participant Financial Responsibility section for
information on when and how participants may be billed.

9.8. Advance Directives
Advanced directives (CPT® 99497 and 99498), or advanced care planning, is a covered
benefit. Advance directives are documents appointing an agent and/or documenting the
participant’s decisions regarding their medical treatment should they lack the capability to
communicate their wishes in the future. Planning may include Health Care Proxy, Durable
Power of Attorney for Health Care, Living Will, or Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining
Treatment.
Hospitals, critical access hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health
agencies, providers of home health care, hospices, and personal care service providers are
required by federal law to offer advanced directives to adult participants or another person
on their behalf as state law allows. It may be rendered by any physician or non-physician
practitioner in any location. It may also be rendered by other staff provided they meet the
minimum direct supervision requirements. Providers may contract another entity to perform
the service and provide information but retain the legal responsibility of ensuring it is
completed correctly. The designated providers are required to offer the following as part of
advance directives:
• All material from the Department of Health and Welfare’s “Your Rights As A Patient To
Make Medical Treatment Decisions”;
• Notification of their rights under State and Federal law to accept or refuse medical and
surgical treatments; and
• Any written policies the provider has on implementing the participant’ rights including
any situation where the provider may have a conflict of conscience and object to the
participant’s wishes. The policies must:
o Clarify institutional conscience and individual professional’s objections;
o Include the legal citation that allows an objection of conscience; and
o Describe what services would be affected by an objection.
Advance directives are voluntary and are only reimbursable if the participant elects to receive
the service. Providers cannot deny services based on the participant’s decision for an advance
directive. This service is billable separately from a global surgical period, an annual wellness
visit, or most evaluation and management services. They are not billable on the same dates
of service as a billed critical care Evaluation and Management service. Time spent on any
other service or treatment is not billable under this service.
A completed Advance Directive form is not required to bill for reimbursement, but
documentation of the offer for an advance directive must be maintained, the existence of any
advanced directive, and if the service is accepted by the participant and additional
documentation must be maintained including:
• The face-to-face encounter.
• The consent for counseling.
• The time the counseling began.
• The duration.
• The explanation of an advance directive; and
• Who was present at the counseling.

9.11. Interpretive Services
Providers are required by law to provide interpretive services to assist participants who are
blind, deaf or who do not speak or understand English. This requirement may be waived if an
emergency situation exists with an imminent threat to the safety and welfare of the participant
or public, or it may be waived if the participant specifically requests an adult family member
or friend be their interpreter/translator.
9.11.1. Interpretive Services Documentation
Documentation must be maintained to support reimbursement of interpretive services. At a
minimum documentation must contain:
• The name and Medicaid Identification Number of the participant;
• If services are not for the participant, the name of the person and their relationship to
the participant’s care;

9.11.2. Interpretive Services for Sterilization Procedures
The interpreter/translator is responsible for ensuring the sterilization consent form is
effectively, accurately and impartially communicated to the participant or their guardian. The
statement certifies the interpreter/translator’s discharge of their duty, their belief that the
participant understood the procedure, and that the participant was allowed to ask questions.
If the interpreter/translator fails to complete the statement correctly, all claims regarding the
sterilization will be denied including claims from the hospital, physician and anesthesiologist.
See Sterilization Procedures in the Medical Services, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for
more information.
9.11.3. Interpretive Services – Reimbursement
Idaho Medicaid will reimburse for interpretation, translation, Braille and sign language
services provided to participants in person or through virtual care. Reimbursement is also
available when interpretive services are provided to the parent or guardian of a child under

oral or written communication. No additional reimbursement is available for multilingual
providers that share a language with the participant. Interpreters and translators must meet
state and professional licensure requirements and be at least eighteen years of age. See the
Virtual Care Services section for more information about reimbursement eligibility using
virtual care services.

9.13. Virtual Care Services
Virtual care or telehealth means providing medically necessary health care services without
actual physical contact, using electronic means. Under Idaho Medicaid this means the
participant and the provider opt to interact in real-time or “live” from two physically different
locations, by video or telephone. Services delivered as virtual services are considered for
reimbursement when rendered within the provider’s scope of practice and billed according to
all applicable administrative rules, policy, federal and state regulations, including those for
protected health information and personal privacy.
Covered services may be delivered via virtual services when:
• The service can be safely and effectively delivered;
• The service fully meets the code definition;
• The service is billed with the FQ or GT modifier; and
• All other existing coverage criteria are met.
Participants (and/or legal guardians), not exempted by State of Federal law, must be informed
and consent to the delivery models, and informed of any applicable cost-sharing, provider
qualifications, treatment methods, and limitations. The provider must give adequate training
on the technology.
If virtual services are offered, it is the rendering provider’s responsibility to ensure meaningful
access to virtual services for individuals with difficulty communicating due to a medical
condition, who need accommodation because of a disability, advanced age, or limited English
proficiency. Meaningful access includes but is not limited to ensuring high-quality audio with
clear and audible transmission of voices and adequate training to users of the technology.
Any electronic or written information must be provided to the participant before the virtual
care appointment and provided in a form and manner which the participant can understand.
The provider must make reasonable accommodations through methods such as a translator
or qualified interpreter when appropriate. Remote interpreting may not be appropriate in
some circumstances
The participant (and/or legal guardian) has the right to end the service or refuse the delivery
of service at any time and have access to all medical information resulting from the service
without affecting their right to future care or treatment. If the participant (or legal guardian)
indicates that they want to stop using the technology, the service should cease immediately,
and an alternative (in-person) appointment should be scheduled. Providers can deliver virtual
care services from any location in the United States. Providers must meet all applicable
licensure requirements required by the State of Idaho.
Services provided via asynchronous communication are not reimbursable under Idaho
Medicaid. However, remote monitoring services are covered for established patients. Remote
Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) and Remote Physiological Monitoring (RTM) cannot be billed
together and must be billed as a distinct and separate service. The use of virtual care services
does not change Health Connections referral or prior authorization requirements established
for the service. For a primary care provider to be reimbursed for virtual care services, the
provider must be able to facilitate an in-person visit if necessary to treat the participant’s
condition. Reporting of test results only is not covered as a virtual service.
Medicaid policy is not subject to Medicare restrictions for virtual care unless the participant
has Medicare primary. Otherwise, all Medicaid providers, including federally qualified health
centers (FQHCs), rural health centers (RHCs), and Indian health clinics (IHCs) may bill for
virtual care services according to these guidelines.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
9.13.1. Virtual Care Services – Technical Requirements
Video must be provided in real-time with full motion video and audio that delivers high-quality
video images that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or irregular pauses
in communication. Transmission of voices must be clear and audible.
9.13.2. Virtual Care Services – Documentation
The individual treatment record must include written documentation of evaluation process,
the services provided, participant consent, participant outcomes, and those services were
delivered via virtual care. The documentation must be of the same quality as is originated
during an in-person visit, including but not limited to, billing the CPT® or HCPCS code with
the number of minutes closest to the actual time spent providing the service, service type,
amount, frequency, duration and time spent with the participant. If the code is a timed code
of 15-minute increments, it must be billed with a number of units as described in the Billing
15-Minute Timed Codes section of the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbook. These documentation requirements are specific to delivery via virtual care and are
in addition to any other documentation requirements specific to the area of service (i.e., IEP
requirements for school-based services).
9.13.3. Virtual Care Services – Reimbursement
Only one eligible provider may be reimbursed per service per participant per date of service.
No reimbursement is available for the use of equipment at the originating or remote sites.
Reimbursement is also not available for services that are interrupted and/or terminated early
due to equipment difficulties. Claims for services delivered via virtual care will be reimbursed
at the same rate as face-to-face services. A service is considered audio only if 50% or more
of the service is provided via audio only. Virtual service visits will be subject to retrospective
review as appropriate.
Idaho Medicaid uses places of service 02 (Telehealth provided other than in patient’s home)
and 10 (Telehealth provided in patient’s home). Providers must use these places of service
on claims for virtual care. When a participant is in the office and receiving virtual care from a
provider at their home, out-of-state or elsewhere, box 32 of the CMS-1500 claim form uses
the location of the participant, not the provider.
Claims for virtual care must include one of the following modifiers:
• FQ – A telehealth service was furnished using real-time audio-only communication
technology.
• GT – A telehealth service was furnished using real-time audio-visual communication
technology.
Additionally, providers can also use the following modifier in conjunction with one of the
above:
• FR – A supervising practitioner was present through a real-time two-way, audio/video
communication technology.
FQHC, RHC or IHS providers should not report the GT or FQ modifier with encounter code
T1015, but should include it with each applicable supporting code.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
9.14. Weight Management Services
Weight management services are covered for Medicaid participants through the behavioral
health benefit of the Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program. Weight management
services are not administered through the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan.
9.14.1. Eligible Participants: Weight Management
Services
Medicaid participants are eligible for weight management services when criteria is met with a
few exceptions. Medicaid participants enrolled in one of the Managed Care Programs for Dual
Eligible Participants may receive applicable PHA benefits through the health plan in which they
are enrolled. Participants eligible for Medicaid through Katie Beckett are not eligible for PHA
benefits.
Participants interested in the Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program begin by visiting
their primary care provider (PCP). The PCP:
• Determines if the participant meets the Body Mass Index (BMI) requirements for their
age group to have one of the covered diagnoses in the table below;
• Confirms the participant does not have an excluded eligibility; and
• Discusses weight management programs with patient and help to identify obtainable
goals.
Covered Diagnoses for Weight Management Services
ICD-10-CM Description
E66.01 Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories. 100lbs overweight.
E66.09 Other obesity due to excess calories. BMI of 30 or higher.
E66.1 Drug-induced obesity. BMI of 30 or higher.
E66.3 Overweight. BMI between 25 and 29.9. Participants over the age of 21 with
this diagnosis are not eligible.
E66.8 Other obesity. BMI of 30 or higher.
E66.9 Obesity, unspecified. BMI of 30 or higher.
R63.6 Underweight
If the PCP determines the participant meets the criteria for the behavioral PHA benefit, the
PCP prints and completes section 1 of the Idaho Medicaid Preventive Health Assistance (PHA)
Weight Management Agreement Form and provides it to the participant or their guardian. The
PCP should also provide the PHA Weight Management Provider List if the participant hasn’t
already found an enrolled weight management services provider.
The participant must select a weight management program from an enrolled provider. The
participant must then take the form to their weight management provider to receive services.
The form does not need to specify the provider so long as they are enrolled in the Idaho
Medicaid program. The form is only valid if the weight management provider returns it to the
Medical Care Unit within two (2) months of the PCP’s signature.
a) Participants Under 21
Participants between age five (5) and twenty-one (21) may qualify for weight management
services if they have a body mass index (BMI) that falls into either the overweight, obese, or
underweight category as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
(CDC) BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen.
July 1, 2025 Page 143 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
b) Participants Over 21
Participants twenty-one (21) years of age and older with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or
higher, or 18½ or lower, may qualify for the weight management program.

9.14.2. Provider Qualifications: Weight Management
Services
Providers of weight management services include, but are not limited to, life style coaches
and other suppliers in the National Diabetes Prevention program, gyms, health clubs and
registered dietitians. Providers, including those that are already enrolled as another provider
type, must enroll as an atypical provider with Idaho Medicaid prior to providing weight
management services under the Preventive Health Program (PHA). Providers must be enrolled
independently as the direct/pay-to and cannot bill as a rendering under a group NPI.
Registered dietitians, however, enrolled with Medicaid do not have to complete a separate
enrollment to provide weight management services within the scope of their licensure. A
registered dietitian can bill for their services as a rendering provider under a group NPI or be
a direct/pay-to provider. If the dietitian offers services beyond nutrition and diet, such as
operating a gym or health club, then the dietitian would need to enroll as an atypical provider
type for those services.
Providers must follow the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook and all applicable state, and
federal, rules and regulations including county and local business licensing requirements. They
must also be established as a business that serves the general public.
See the Provider Enrollment section for more information on enrolling as an Idaho Medicaid
provider.
9.14.3. Covered Services and Limitations: Weight
Management Services
The behavioral benefit of the Preventive Health Program (PHA) awards points to enrolled
Medicaid participants to redeem for weight management services. Weight management
services must either address physical fitness, balanced diet or personal health education.
These can include services under the National Diabetes Prevention Program, gym fees,
healthy lifestyle classes or nutrition classes. Participants earn 200 points under the behavioral
benefit during each benefit period.
Benefit periods last twelve months from when the participant is approved for the program.
Participants may reapply after or near the end of their benefit period if they still meet criteria
for the program. Benefit periods cannot overlap. Points cannot be transferred to another
participant. Any points not utilized during their issued benefit period, expire. Points can be
July 1, 2025 Page 144 of 162
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Information and Requirements for Providers
redeemed by voucher with a Medicaid enrolled provider at a rate of one-point to one-dollar
towards eligible services.
Weight management providers must verify eligibility when they receive the voucher. Providers
can only verify eligibility for PHA weight management services by calling Gainwell
Technologies customer service at 1 (866) 686-4272.

9.14.4. Reimbursement: Weight Management Services
Services must meet all Medicaid requirements to be eligible for reimbursement. Idaho
Medicaid reimburses weight management services on a fee-for-service basis. Services are
reimbursed at 100% of the invoiced amount up to the maximum on the participant’s voucher,
so long as the participant has points remaining to redeem. Once a participant has exhausted
their benefit, the participant is liable for any remaining balance due from services provided
under the PHA behavioral benefit that are not otherwise covered by Idaho Medicaid. See the
Participant Financial Responsibility section for requirements on billing a participant.
Claims must be submitted on a CMS-1500 form to Gainwell Technologies via mail or the
provider portal for reimbursement. Covered services and the corresponding billing codes are
found in the table below. Reimbursement is only available for participants with one of the
diagnoses listed in the Eligible Participants: Weight Management Services section billed as the
primary diagnosis on the claim. See the General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbook regarding policy on billing, prior authorization and requirements for billing all other
third-party resources before submitting claims to Medicaid.

9.15. CHIP Wellness Incentive
Children enrolled in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are required to pay a
monthly premium of $10 or $15. The Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) program as part of
its wellness benefit provides ten (10) points a month to participants, who keep up-to-date on
their well child exams and immunizations. Points are then converted into a $10 credit towards
the participant’s monthly CHIP premium. Preventive care including well child exams, vaccines
and their administration (immunizations) are not subject to copayments.
Points accumulated through the PHA wellness benefit are only redeemable towards CHIP
premiums. A participant can only receive 120 points in a twelve-month period. Points cannot
be transferred to another participant. Any points not utilized during their issued twelve-month
period, expire.
Statements are mailed to parents on a monthly basis. If a parent knows their child is up-to-
date on their well checks and immunizations, they may ask their primary care provider (PCP)
to fax verification of the checkup or immunizations to the Medical Care Unit at 1 (877) 845-
3956. If you have questions about the PHA program, please call the Medical Care Unit toll
free at 1 (877) 364-1843.
