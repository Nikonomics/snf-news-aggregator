Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
General Billing Instructions
The General Billing Instructions, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, is applicable to all
provider types, and must be followed except where otherwise stated for a specific provider
type. Should the handbook ever appear to contradict relevant provisions of Idaho or federal
regulations, the regulations prevail. Any paper or digital copy of these documents is
considered out of date except the version appearing on Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid
website.
This handbook covers basic billing information providers need to submit claims and
adjustments to Idaho Medicaid for services processed by Gainwell Technologies (GWT). It
describes Medicaid billing policies; how to submit claims electronically, on paper, or directly
into Health PAS; how to check claim status or where to get help with claim submital. In
addition, it describes the prior authorization (PA) process, third party liability (TPL), and claim
review requests/pre-appeals/adjustments (both online and paper).
Providers must follow their provider type or service specific handbook as located in the
Provider Guidelines. Handbook sections in addition to this one that always apply to providers
include:
• General Information and Requirements for Providers; and
• Glossary.
Handbooks can only be used properly in context. Providers must be familiar with the
handbooks that affect them and their services. The numbering in handbooks is also important
to make note of as subsections rely on the content of the sections above them.
Example
Section 1.2.3.a The Answer requires the reader to have also read Section 1,
Section 1.2 and Section 1.2.3 to be able to properly apply Section 1.2.3.a.
References are included throughout the handbook for provider and staff convenience. Not all
applicable references have been incorporated into the handbook. Not all references provided
are equal in weight.
• Case Law: Includes references to court cases that established interpretations of law
that states and providers would be required to follow.
• CMS Guidance: These references reflect various Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their
policy. The publications are not required to be followed for Idaho Medicaid services.
• Federal Regulations: These references are regulations from the federal level that
affected policy development. Usually these include the Code of Federal Regulations,
the Social Security Act and other statutes. Federal regulations must be followed.
• Idaho Medicaid Publications: These are communications from Idaho Medicaid to
providers that were required to be followed when published. These are included in the
handbook for historical reference. The provider handbook supersedes other
communications unless the documents are listed in the Policies, Procedures, and
Waivers webpage under policies in Medicaid Policies library.
• Idaho State Plan: The State Plan is the agreement between the State of Idaho and the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on how the State will administer its medical
assistance program.
• Professional Organizations: These references reflect various publications of
professional organizations that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the formulation of their
July 1, 2025 Page 1 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
policy. Providers may or may not be required to follow these references, depending on
the individual reference and its application to a provider’s licensure and scope of
practice.
• Scholarly Work: These references are publications that Idaho Medicaid reviewed in the
formulation of their policy. The publications themselves are not required to be followed
for Idaho Medicaid services.
• State Regulations: These references are regulations from the state level that affected
policy development. They usually include statute and IDAPA. They are required to be
followed.
Some citations may not be available on the internet. Copies of the documents may be
requested with a public records request. Guidance for public records requests is available on
the Department’s website.

1. Medicaid Billing Policies
Once enrolled, providers may bill for services rendered to Idaho Medicaid participants.
Providers are not obligated to accept all Medicaid participants on an ongoing, day-to-day
basis. Provider enrollment signifies only that a provider will bill Medicaid if they accept a
Medicaid participant as a patient. Providers shall charge their usual and customary fee for
services and submit those charges to Medicaid for payment consideration unless otherwise
instructed.
Providers must accept payment from Medicaid as payment in full for covered services. See
the Participant Financial Responsibility section of the General Information and Requirements
for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for circumstances when a participant may
be billed.
If the participant has other insurance, the provider must bill the other insurance and complete
all billing requirements for that carrier first, and then bill Medicaid. See the Third-Party
Liability section for additional information.
Idaho Medicaid does not support billing and payment by cost centers. Hospitals should bill
applicable revenue codes listed in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook. Revenue
codes not listed are not covered.
To be eligible for reimbursement, providers must abide by Department communications such
as Information Releases, MedicAide newsletters, the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, and
state and federal regulations. Coverage policies in place at the time of service should be
followed. Policies on how to bill may change and be retroactive to the date of service to
accommodate the claim system. This is to ensure successful payment of claims without
significant delay.
Information provided by Gainwell Technologies (GWT), Idaho Medicaid’s contractor, cannot
supersede these requirements or substitute the provider’s responsibility to understand and
follow them.

1.2 Billing Procedure for Date Spanning
For CMS 1500 Claims, non-consecutive dates should not be spanned on a single claim detail.
Providers risk claim denials due to duplicate logic, overlapping dates, and/or mutually
exclusive edits.
When date spanning, services must have been provided for every day within that span. For
example, it would be incorrect to date span the entire week or month when services were
only performed on Thursday and Saturday within the same week or January 1 and January
10 within the same month.
Example
For services provided to the participant on the following days:
Thursday, December 11, 2020
Saturday, December 13, 2020
...enter each date on a separate detail line.
Example of Date Spanning
Date(s) of Service Procedure
Charges
Code
12/11/2020 – 12/11/2020 XXXXX $ XXX.XX
12/13/2020 – 12/13/2020 XXXXX $ XXX.XX
For UB-04 Claims, non-consecutive dates can be spanned on a single claim, however,
providers should be careful to not create an outpatient claim that overlaps an inpatient claim.
Outpatient claims that overlap inpatient claims will be denied unless otherwise stated in the
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.

1.3 Billing 15-Minute Timed Codes
Several CPT® and HCPC codes used for evaluations, therapy modalities, procedures, and
collateral contacts specify that one (1) unit equals 15 minutes. Providers must bill procedure
codes for the services they delivered using CPT® codes and the appropriate number of units
of service. The beginning and ending time of the treatment must be recorded in the
participant’s medical record with a note describing the treatment. Only time spent directly
working with the participant is counted. For any single CPT® code, providers may bill a single
15-minute unit for treatment that is greater than or equal to eight (8) minutes and less than
23 minutes in a day. Time intervals for treatments lasting 23-minutes or longer on a single
date of service are as follows:
Units for 15 Minute Timed Codes
Number of Units Time Interval
2 units ≥ 23 minutes to < 38 minutes
3 units ≥ 38 minutes to < 53 minutes
4 units ≥ 53 minutes to < 68 minutes
5 units ≥ 68 minutes to < 83 minutes
6 units ≥ 83 minutes to < 98 minutes
7 units ≥ 98 minutes to < 113 minutes
8 units ≥ 113 minutes to < 128 minutes
The pattern remains the same for treatment times over two hours. Providers should not bill
for services performed for less than eight (8) minutes. The expectation (based on work values
for these codes) is that a provider’s time for each unit will average 15 minutes in length. If a
provider has a practice of billing less than 15 minutes for a unit, these situations should be
highlighted for review.
When more than one service represented by codes and measured in 15-minute increments is
performed on a single date of service, the total number of minutes for all services should be
added together to determine the number of units that can be billed for that date of service.
Multiple timed services should not be combined into a single billing code. See the “Units for
15 Minute Timed Codes” table above to determine how many units are billable. The total
number of units billable should be distributed based on the time spent per code to best fit the
allowed units. See the examples below for appropriate time coding.
Billing Multiple 15 Minute Timed Codes
Time
Spent
Billed
Units Explanation
Example 1
Code 1 36 minutes Code 2 35 minutes 2
Total 71 minutes 5
3 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed
Codes” 71 minutes equals 5 units. Each of the codes was
billed for 30 minutes so should be billed at least a
minimum of 2 units each. Since Code 1 took more time
than Code 2 the remaining unit should be assigned there
even though by itself Code 1 wouldn’t qualify for 3 units.
Example 2
Code 1 20 minutes Code 2 20 minutes 1
Total 40 minutes 3
2 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed
Codes” 40 minutes equals 3 units. Each of the codes was
billed for at least 15 minutes so should be billed at least
1 units each. Since both services took the same amount
July 1, 2025 Page 6 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
of time, the provider can assign the remaining unit to
either code they decide.
Example 3
Code 1 33 minutes Code 2 7 minutes 1
Total 40 minutes 3
2 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed
Codes” 40 minutes equals 3 units. Code 1 was provided
for 2 full units. Since Code 2 did not meet the 8-minute
threshold for 1 unit, compare the unassigned time from
Code 1 (3 minutes) with Code 2 (7 minutes). Bill the
remaining unit with the code that has the largest
unassigned time i.e., Code 2.
Example 4
Code 1 16 minutes Code 2 10 minutes 1
Code 3 10 minutes 1
Code 4 8 minutes 0
Total 44 minutes 3
1 According to the chart above, “Units for 15 Minute Timed
Codes” 49 minutes equals 3 units. All codes performed
would qualify for a single unit on the chart above, but
since they were performed on the same day the time is
added up to determine the number of billable units.
Since all the codes qualify for 1 unit, the units are
divided equally among the top codes. Although Code 4
isn’t being reimbursed directly, it must still be
documented since its time is being reimbursed in the
other codes.
Example 5
Code 1 7 minutes Code 2 7 minutes 0
Code 3 7 minutes 0
Total 21 minutes 1
1 According to this section 21 minutes is eligible for 1 unit.
As all the codes were performed for the same amount of
time, the performing professional selects once to bill with
the 1 unit. Although Codes 2 and 3 aren’t being
reimbursed directly, they must be documented since
their time is being used to justify the reimbursement for
Code 1.

1.4 Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)
Home Health agencies and Personal Assistance Agencies (PAA) must submit Electronic Visit
Verification (EVV) data to the state’s EVV Aggregator to be eligible for payment of certain
claims in compliance with Section 12006(a) of the 21st Century Cures Act. The state’s EVV
Aggregator and related certification and training materials are provided by Sandata
(www.sandata.com).
PAA EVV data is reviewed quarterly by the Bureau of Long-Term Care (BLTC). The required
compliance threshold is automatically verified visit data for 85% or more of visits that occur
in the reporting period. Any provider that has 15% or more of its EVV visits manually verified
in any quarter will be required to improve. The EVV Provider Help Aid is available to assist
providers.
As part of its EVV data monitoring process, the BLTC will identify providers that were deficient
in the reporting quarter.
• If the provider is deficient for the second consecutive calendar quarter, the provider
will receive a request for an EVV Action Plan. The provider must return the completed
action plan via email to BLTCQA@dhw.idaho.gov. The provider will receive an approval
or denial of their plan from a BLTC Quality Assurance Specialist.
• If the provider was not deficient during the previous quarter, an email notification will
be sent with an EVV Response Form. The agency must return the completed form via
email to BLTCQA@dhw.idaho.gov. Technical assistance is available by request.
1.4.1 Request with No Provider Response
Providers that do not respond to requests will have their payment for claims held and a referral
will be made to Medicaid Program Integrity Unit.
1.4.2 EVV: Applicable Providers and Services
Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) data submittal is required for the following providers and
services:

1.5 False or Improper Claims
Providers are liable for claims for services submitted on their behalf. Any provider, who
knowingly or should have known, submitted claims for items or services not provided as
claimed, or upcoded claims, may be liable for criminal and/or civil monetary penalties and
exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This includes misrepresentation of
services as being provided by a physician, when they were provided by another provider type,
and services that are known, or should have been known, not to be medically necessary.

1.6 Hospice Participants
Providers can check a participant’s hospice status by calling Gainwell Technologies at 1 (866)
686-4272 and asking a customer service representative to check the participant record for a
hospice alert for the date of service. When a participant is on hospice care, the hospice agency
is responsible for all services related to the hospice diagnosis. If a provider bills for services
not related to the participant's hospice diagnosis to expedite payment, the provider may
submit a claim via direct data entry (DDE) using the provider’s Trading Partner Account (TPA)
and attach supporting documentation that the services are not related to the hospice
diagnosis. Supporting documentation can include a visit summary or an explanatory letter.
Any issues or questions concerning services for hospice participants should be referred to the
hospice provider.

1.7 340B Pharmacy Billing
Congress created the Medicaid rebate program to lower the cost of pharmaceuticals
reimbursed by state Medicaid agencies. Congress extended to safety-net providers the same
kind of relief from high drug costs that Congress provided to the Medicaid program with the
Medicaid rebate law with the 340B requirements. This may apply to the outpatient pharmacy
program, hospitals, and to physician-administered drugs.
Providers who obtain status as a 340B pharmacy and receive reduced costs from the
manufacturer must determine if they will provide drugs from their 340B stock to Idaho
Medicaid participants. According to regulations, 340B providers may bill in one of two ways:
•
•
“carve Medicaid in”
“carve Medicaid out”
Providers choosing to “carve Medicaid in” have to enroll with Idaho Medicaid as a 340B entity
and provide a copy of their completed Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
304B registration. Under this option, providers must use their 340B stock for Medicaid
participants. This applies to the provider’s inpatient services, outpatient clinics and retail
pharmacies. Contract pharmacies, however, are not eligible under the 340B program unless
they separately enroll.
Carved-in 340B providers must only bill for drugs from their 340B stock for those drugs
received under that program. Providers must bill no more than the acquisition price on 340B
claims and append the UD modifier for primary Medicaid or commercial plan claims. Providers
billing Medicare as primary must use the JG or TB modifier, as applicable. Reimbursement will
be limited to the provider’s actual acquisition cost not to exceed the 340B ceiling price with a
professional dispensing fee.
Providers that choose the option to “carve Medicaid out” must use drugs purchased through
regular rates and prices. The provider is required to bill their usual and customary price for
these drugs on their claims and will be paid at the usual rate. A carved-in provider that elects
to withdraw from the program must provide thirty (30) days’ notice.

office is defined as the location where the provider routinely provides outpatient services and
is operated during the hours that the provider engages in treatment at that location. The
office space must be owned, leased, or rented by the provider/group and used for the
exclusive purpose of operating the practice during those hours.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
1.9 Prior Authorization
A prior authorization (PA) is a written, faxed or electronic approval from the Department that
permits payment or coverage of an item or service that is only covered by such an
authorization. This section only covers PAs for services billed through Gainwell Technologies
(GWT). Some items and services always require a PA, such as:
• Items and services identified on the Numerical Fee Schedule;
• Services listed in the Appendix of the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for
ICD-10-PCS codes that always require a PA.
• Service Coordination services for children with special health needs;
• Community-based Crisis Services;
• Home and community-based services (HCBS) for the following waivers:
o Adult Developmental Disabilities (DD) Waiver; and
o Aged and Disabled (A&D) Waiver;
• Personal care services, including family personal care services (FPCS);
• Preventative Health Assistance (PHA) services;
• Cosmetic and reconstructive surgery;
• Services/procedures for participants under the age of 21, identified as medically
necessary as part of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT);
• Surgery related to obesity;
• Transition Management for referral and relocation assistance after extended
hospitalization;
• Transplants;
• Transportation by an ambulance or individual/commercial transportation provider for
non-emergency Medicaid covered services from an Idaho Medicaid medical provider;
and
• Any urgent/emergency inpatient or outpatient treatment where the procedure or
diagnosis code appears on the select pre-authorization list must be reviewed by
Telligen within one working day of admission. The surgical procedures on the select
pre-authorization list must be authorized regardless of the place of service. The
diagnoses on the select pre-authorization list are for inpatient only.
Other services may only require a PA under these circumstances:
• The participant has exhausted their benefit;
• The participant does not meet the established criteria, but can demonstrate a medical
need; or
• The participant has an additional benefit such as EPSDT services or a waiver that can
only be accessed through a prior authorization.
Items and services that require a PA must receive approval before they can be delivered to
the participant except as otherwise noted. It is the provider’s responsibility to verify the
participant’s eligibility on the date of service and to request any required PA. PA requirements
specific to a service or item are listed throughout the handbook for the provider’s convenience.
For information regarding whether a prior authorization is required, providers can use the
below resources for services billed to GWT:
• Check participant eligibility and PA requirements through their Trading Partner Account at
www.idmedicaid.com;
• Check the Idaho Medicaid Numerical Fee Schedule available online for CPT® and HCPCS
that always require a PA; and
• See the Appendix in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for ICD-10-PCS codes
that always require a PA.
July 1, 2025 Page 18 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
PA requests are rejected when there is no clear indication that a prior authorization is
required. Providers should note the reason for the request in the notes section of the portal
or form when the item or service does not always require a prior authorization.
Urgent requests may be submitted by writing “urgent” on the request form. Urgent requests
should only be submitted when the participant needs equipment, services, or supplies to
discharge from a facility or to prevent immediate admission to one. Urgent requests for
discharge, must include the expected date of discharge on the request form.
Requests for a PA or an approved authorization for services does not guarantee payment. All
other Department requirements must be met. Authorizations only confirm medical necessity
criteria has been met for the item or service based on the documentation submitted. The
Department’s, or its designee’s, review of prior authorizations includes general criteria
requirements in addition to any item specific criteria. Reviews do not determine if a provider
or place of service is appropriate or any other considerations. Reimbursement is dependent
on the participant’s eligibility on the date authorized services are rendered. The claim for
reimbursement must meet all applicable requirements such as:
• Policy requirements;
• Be appropriate and effective treatment for the participant’s current medical condition;
• Be furnished by providers with the appropriate credentials;
• Be the most cost-effective method of meeting the participant’s medical needs; and
• Meet all federal and state regulations.
Medicaid issues written notifications of authorization or denials for all written requests for PA.
Participants receive a Notice of Decision by mail with information on appeal rights and how to
request a hearing if they disagree with the Department’s decision. Providers receive
notifications based on their profile’s preferences. If the participant or provider disagrees with
the Department’s decision they can request a reconsideration or file an appeal.
Approved authorizations are valid only for the period between the start and stop dates. If the
service is to be delivered outside of the approved dates, a new PA request must be submitted.
Requests should be made before the expiration of the previous authorization to avoid breaks
in care. Providers billing for authorized services or items must include PA numbers on the
appropriate claim line or they will deny. Claims for inpatient services must have prior
authorization numbers on the header or each claim line, or the claim will deny. Some
authorizations may also include modifiers as part of the approval. Authorizations that include
a modifier must include it on the claim line, or it will deny. The PA number and any required
modifier are found on the paper Notice of Decision (NOD) letter or online through the Trading
Partner Account (TPA) under View Authorizations.
Medical items or services subject to a PA by Idaho Medicaid’s designated authorizing entity,
will deny for payment, if provided prior to obtaining authorization unless otherwise specified.
Exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis, if the provider demonstrates an effort to
submit a timely request or due to events beyond the control of the provider, a prior
authorization was not obtained; e.g., a hospital discharge, outside of business hours, etc. An
explanation of the delay in submission must accompany the PA request and include any
supporting documentation with a request for an exception. Providers may not bill Medicaid
participants for services not reimbursed by Medicaid because the PA was not obtained in a
timely manner or because the provider failed to verify that a PA was required.
If an individual is not eligible for Medicaid at the time items or services requiring a PA were
provided but was subsequently found eligible pursuant to retroactive Medicaid eligibility, a
request must be submitted with all required documentation within 30 days of the date the
July 1, 2025 Page 19 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
provider became aware of the individual’s Medicaid eligibility. The item or service will be
reviewed by the Department retroactively using the same medical necessity guidelines that
apply to other prior authorization requests. If approved, the provider should refund any
amount previously collected from the participant for the item or service to the participant.
The Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook contains addresses and telephone
numbers for entities that review prior authorizations. Depending on the service, a PA may be
received from the:
• Division of Medicaid Central Office
• Regional Developmental Disabilities Program
• Bureau of Long Term Care (BLTC)
• Telligen, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO)
Participants with Medicare as their primary insurance do not require a PA from Idaho Medicaid
for Medicare approved items and services. If the services are not covered by Medicare, or the
participant has another primary payor, prior authorizations from Medicaid are required as if
the participant had Medicaid primary.

1.9.2 Medicaid Prior Authorization
Idaho Medicaid issues a written notification of authorization or denial for all written requests for
prior authorization (PA). Notices include PA numbers and may include modifiers which must
be used when billing for approved services. To render a service that requires a Medicaid PA,
download and complete the appropriate form. Fax the form and documentation justifying the
medical necessity of the procedure to the fax number on the form.
Direct all requests for PAs to the appropriate contractor or Department unit as listed in the
Directory, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.
The requests should include:
• Participant name and Medicaid Identification (MID) number
• Signed physician’s order
• A list of all items and a price quote for each
• Prescriber’s statement of diagnosis and medical necessity for applicable drugs
• Requesting provider
• Additional information as identified by the reviewing entity
Prior Authorization Dates of Service
The PA letter indicates the length of time the authorization is valid. The dates of service billed
must occur on or after the start date and on or before the expiration date indicated on the PA
letter. If the PA expiration date occurs before services are provided, a new PA must be
requested. To prevent a disruption or break in service to the participant, request a PA as soon
as the need for additional services is identified.
Modifiers and Prior Authorization (PA)
The PA letter will specify when a modifier has been added to the PA. Modifiers are used to
increase accuracy in compensation, coding consistency, editing, and to capture payment data.
At times, reviewers for Idaho Medicaid may attach a modifier to a procedure code when a PA
is approved.
When a provider receives notification of an approved PA, it is essential to check the
authorization to determine if a modifier is attached to any of the approved procedure codes.
If there is a modifier attached to any approved code on the approved PA, that modifier must
be used when billing for the service or the claim will deny.
Modifiers other than those listed on the approved PA may also be appropriate in billing for the
service and should be included on the claim.
Prior Authorization (PA) Forms
PA forms for many service and provider types can be found on the Idaho Gainwell
Technologies Medicaid website. Specific prior authorization instructions can be found in the
specific provider type handbook.
Physician Administered Drugs (PAD) Requiring PA
Certain PADs require prior authorization. Refer to the Numerical Fee Schedule on the DHW
website.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
1.9.6 Prior Authorization Reconsiderations
(a) Department Reconsiderations
Providers should request reconsiderations of a prior authorization (PA) decision when requests
are denied for incompleteness, extenuating circumstances should be considered, or additional
documentation is submitted to support medical necessity. Reconsiderations shall be requested
within 28 days of the Department’s decision. Providers must include the PA number on the
request and include previous documentation for it to be considered. If the PA number is not
provided, a denial may be issued for an incomplete request. Reconsiderations are submitted
to the same reviewer as the original request when possible.
Upon completion of the reconsideration review, Idaho Medicaid or its designee will issue a
second Notice of Decision for Medical Benefits. If the provider or participant disagrees with
the PA reconsideration decision made by Idaho Medicaid or its designee, they may file a
Request for Appeal. The provider or participant has 28 days from the mailing date of the
second Notice of Decision for Medical Benefits to submit a formal appeal.
(b) Telligen Reconsiderations
Advisory letters sent from Telligen to physicians, hospitals, and participants provide two (2)
options for appeals, Reconsiderations and Department Appeals. Reconsiderations are
optional, 1st level appeals. Providers must complete Reconsiderations with Telligen before
submitting an appeal to the Department’s Appeals Coordinator. Reconsiderations must be
submitted within 180 days of receipt of the Notice of Decision. Another peer physician will
review the medical records, and any new information submitted. The provider will be notified
of the determination within 30 days. If a provider disagrees with the final decision or chooses
not to go through the reconsideration process, they can submit a Department Appeal.
Telligen Reconsiderations can be expedited when they meet the definition of an urgent care
case shown in the Telligen provider manual (Idmedicaid.telligen.com). Urgent requests can
be made by telephone, fax, or in writing within two (2) business days after notification.
Telligen completes the request within two (2) business days of receipt. Providers who disagree
with the results of the expedited request determination or have not submitted one, have an
option of submitting a standard request.
A Department Appeal may be requested after the reconsideration process is exhausted with
Telligen. When the provider chooses not to submit a request for Reconsideration, the appeal
must be received in writing by the Department’s Appeals Coordinator within 28 days from the
mailing date of the Notice of Decision letter that the provider is appealing. For more
information on Department Appeals, please see the Prior Authorization Appeals section of this
handbook.

1.9.8 Transferring a Prior Authorization
Participants have the right to choose their provider and may change providers at any time.
There are some exceptions such as the Healthy Connections program. The initial prior
authorization (PA) does not automatically transfer when the participant chooses a new
provider. The participant or their parent or guardian is required to contact the issuing
authority verbally or in writing of their intent to change providers. Transfers through Telligen
require the newly selected provider to submit an updated Prior Authorization Form indicating
the request is for a transfer. Supporting documentation is not necessary to transfer an existing
PA.

1.10 Professional and Technical Components
Certain procedures are a combination of a physician or other qualified health care professional
component and a technical component. The professional and technical components together
are referred to as the “global service”. Professional (26) and technical (TC) component
modifiers were established for some services to distinguish the portion of a service provided
by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional.
The technical component includes charges for personnel and materials, space, equipment,
and other facility charges and is generally billed by the entity that provides the testing
equipment. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® of HCPCS code with the TC modifier to
identify a charge for the technical component. Providers must use the appropriate CPT® or
HCPCS code with the 26 modifier to identify a charge for the professional component of a
diagnostic service/procedure which includes supervision, interpretation, and a written report.
If the technical and professional components of a service are performed by the same provider,
the service would be billed using the appropriate CPT code without modifier 26 or TC.
The introduction of the American Medical Association, CPT, 2016 edition, defines results,
testing, interpretation, and report and states:
“Results are the technical component of a service. Testing leads to results; results lead to
interpretation. Reports are the work product of the interpretation of test results. Certain
procedures or services described in a CPT involve a technical component (e.g.; tests) which
produces “results” (e.g.; data; images, slides). For clinical use, some of these results require
interpretation. Some CPT descriptors specifically require interpretation and reporting to report
that code.”
There are CPT codes that describe professional-only and technical-only services that would
be billed without a 26 or TC modifier. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
Professional Component/Technical Component indicators in the National Physician Fee
Schedule (NPFS) Relative Value File can be used to help determine whether a CPT code is
eligible for separate reimbursement for professional and technical services.

1.11 Manually Priced Goods and Services
Procedure codes which appear on the Medicaid Numerical Fee Schedule with a reimbursement
amount of $0.00 must have the appropriate documentation for the code to be priced correctly
with the exception of pharmaceuticals on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), 340B supplied
pharmaceuticals, and anesthesia codes. If the code is prior authorized and not a
pharmaceutical, the documentation must be sent with the prior authorization request. If the
code is not prior authorized, then the documentation must be attached to the claim. Services
on claims or authorization requests without the required attachments will deny.
Documentation must be legible and not handwritten. Providers can only alter documentation
from third parties when multiple items or services are listed and it’s necessary to draw
attention to the item or service being provided, or to cover lines that do not apply to the
current request.
Amounts invoiced directly to the Department must be at the provider’s usual and customary
rate, which is the amount the provider charges to Medicare beneficiaries and other patients
liable for such charges, as supported by the provider’s records. This amount must be adjusted
to reflect the provider’s billing policies so that the amount reflects what the provider receives
through reasonable collection efforts.
Pharmaceuticals listed on the WAC list, except those supplied as 340B drugs, are paid at the
lower of the provider’s charges or the WAC price for the drug. 340B drugs are paid at the
provider’s charge. No documentation is necessary for items on the WAC list or from 340B
supplies. To accurately price all other drugs, provide the actual amount given to the patient
when billing. Pharmaceuticals not on the WAC list are priced using the tangible goods
methodology. In addition to the methodology’s required documentation, for pricing providers
must supply:
• The description of the procedure code or its billable units (i.e. 1mg); and
• An explanation of the units billed on the service line (i.e. 32 units billed for procedure
code measured at 1mg to indicate 32mg were provided).
Genetic laboratory tests, imaging, radiology and surgical procedures are priced by the Medical
Care Unit based off the submitted documentation. Acceptable documentation for these
services includes an invoice on letterhead with:
• The Department as the entity being invoiced;
• The Idaho Medicaid provider as the invoicing entity;
• A date of invoice (Dates after the date of service are acceptable);
• For genetic testing use the date the specimen was obtained, or the test was ordered,
or for surgical procedures the date of the surgery; and
• The service provided and corresponding procedure code.
Tangible goods are priced at cost + 10% + shipping for pricing using invoices, or 75% of the
Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). Documentation cannot be handwritten.
Documentation is unacceptable if its date is after the date of service except where otherwise
noted. Acceptable documentation for tangible goods includes:
• Screenshot of online purchase with confirmation number;
• Invoices from the manufacturer or wholesaler including:
o The name of the provider as the entity being invoiced;
o The manufacturer or wholesaler’s information as the invoicing entity;
o A date of invoice, order, ship, or capture within the past 365 days for
nonperishable goods or the date of service for perishable items. Dates after the
date of service will result in denial unless the invoice includes:
▪ Participant’s full or last name;
▪ Participant’s medical record number;
July 1, 2025 Page 31 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
▪ A date of service and physician’s name that match the claim; or
▪ A purchase order with the date of service, with the participant’s medical
record number, full or last name, and the invoice containing the
purchase order number.
o The procedure code;
o The provider’s cost after discounts;
o Units of measurement (i.e. box, carton, package, each, etc.); if applicable;
▪ The quantity within the unit of measurement, such as the number of
items within the box; and
o All pages of the invoice or total for all charges, and the quantities of all the
items left visible, if shipping and handling reimbursement are requested;
• Invoices from the provider for the professional services in customizing and/or
fabricating goods (invoices for a good being customized, but was fabricated by a third
party must meet the manufacturer or wholesaler invoice requirements); or
• Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) as demonstrated by:
o A catalog published within the past 365 days;
o A recent advertisement; or
o Other documentation directly from the manufacturer such as a quote.
Codes are not manually priced for acute care hospitals reimbursed under APR DRG
methodologies and are instead paid out at a percent of covered charges. See the Hospital,
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for a list of codes.

1.12 Timely Filing Limit
Timely filing refers to the requirement that a complete claim be submitted to any carrier within
a time period specified by the carrier.
For an Idaho Medicaid claim to be considered as filed on a timely basis, the complete claim
must be submitted, and an Internal Control Number (ICN) assigned within 12 months (365
days) of the start date of service or in the case of an institutional claim from the through date
of service. There are three exceptions to this requirement:
1) Services for dually eligible participants (those who have both Medicare and Medicaid)
provided through fee-for-service network provider must be billed to Idaho Medicaid
within 12 months (365 days) of the start date of service or six (6) months of the date
of payment/date of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Medicare Remittance Notice
(MRN), whichever is greater. (See the Medicare Processing section for more
information on processing paid or denied Medicare claims.)
2) If the participant is approved for Medicaid coverage after the date of service, DHW
issues a detailed Notice of Action (NOA) explaining the retroactive eligibility. To be
considered within the timely filing limits, the claim for this participant must be
submitted within 12 months (365 days) of the notice date on the letter. (See the
Participant Retroactive Eligibility section for more information.)
3) Inpatient claims with a length of stay exceeding 12 months (365 days) must be
submitted within 60-days of discharge to be considered timely.
Claims submitted within the timely filing period do not need to be in a paid status to be
considered for timely filing. They can be in a paid, pended, or denied status if they are in the
processing system within 365 days of the start date of service for professional claims or within
365 days of the through date of service for institutional claims.

1.12.2 Documentation to Support Timely Filing
When billing Idaho Medicaid, it is important to include documentation with your claim of a
qualifying exception to the timely filing period. Documentation accepted for an exception to
timely filing includes:
• Paper claims which require an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from Medicare and display
the paid date
• Retro Eligibility document/Notice of Action for the participant
• County Indigent Fund Notification
When you send an EOB from any payer for any reason, it must include the other payer’s
processing information to support the submitted claim. Additional required documentation
from the other payer is the page which explains the applicable remark codes, so the
payment/denial information can be correctly interpreted.
The documentation can be mailed with a paper claim or scanned and attached to your Health
PAS-Online entry.

1.12.3 Participant Retroactive Eligibility
Claims for Idaho Medicaid participants who receive retroactive eligibility must be submitted
no more than 365 days from the date on the retroactive eligibility approval letter issued to
the participant. The retroactive eligibility approval letter, also called the Notice of Action,
should be attached, if available, to the claim for timely filing documentation. If the notice is
unavailable, the provider should write and attach a letter attesting to when and how they
received notification of the participant’s eligibility, and request Gainwell Technologies review
the claim under retroactive eligibility for timely filing. If the claim is denied the claim review
process may be used for further consideration.

1.12.5 Medicare Processing
A participant who has both Medicare and Medicaid (Duals) coverage is considered dually
eligible. See Third Party Liability for more information about Duals.
Providers must bill Medicare first for services and follow their billing requirements. If Medicare
denies a claim for timely filing, Medicaid will also deny it for timely filing. Most of the time
claims processed by Medicare are sent electronically to Medicaid for processing. These
electronically forwarded claims are called crossover claims.
If the Medicare claim is not included in the electronic crossover or for those situations where
it is necessary to bill Medicaid after Medicare has paid, it is necessary to submit a paper claim
or an electronic claim within 6 months of the date of the Medicare payment or denial. That
date will be the date of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)/Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN).
The applicable EOB/MRN should be attached to the claim; be sure to include the page with
the processing information about the claim you are submitting and the page that explains the
applicable remark codes.

1.13 Usual and Customary Fees
Providers shall charge their usual and customary fee for services and submit those charges
to Medicaid for payment consideration unless otherwise instructed. The Department generally
reimburses at the lesser of billed charges or the established reimbursement cap for the item
or service. When there are retrospective rate increases or decreases, the adjusted rates are
added to the system and DHW initiates mass adjustments to previously paid claims for that
time period that the rates have been adjusted. If the original claim was billed at the Medicaid
allowed amount and the rate is increased retrospectively, the adjusted claim will pay at the
original billed amount. The provider will not receive additional reimbursement.
The Office of the Inspector General may exclude any provider from receiving money from the
Medicare and Medicaid programs if they are found to be billing substantially more than their
usual charges or costs for services and items.

2. Claim Form Instructions
2.1 Participant Identification
The participant’s name is used in conjunction with the Medicaid identification number (MID)
when submitting claims to verify coverage. Claims will be returned if a matching participant
is not identified.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant Idaho Gainwell
Technologies Medicaid secure website allows the provider to search for the participant’s name
as it is on file with Medicaid. The provider is required to enter only the first five letters of the
participant’s last name and the first three letters of the participant’s first name.
Common errors that are made when entering the name on the claim form include:
• Spelling mistakes and typing errors;
• Name not entered in correct order, or the participant may use a hyphenated last name;
• When entering a two-word last name, not starting with the lead name. (E.g., Van S.

3. Required Coding
Idaho Medicaid uses codes as listed in the most current version of:
• Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)® from the American Medical
Association (AMA);
• Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature (CDT)® from the American Dental
Association (ADA)®;
• Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) from the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS);
• International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) from the
World Health Organization (WHO); and
• International Classification of Diseases Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) from
the World Health Organization (WHO).
Providers are expected to select a code from one of these sets that best defines the service
provided. The provider must bill the most specific code to the service provided. As part of
correct coding requirements, miscellaneous, not otherwise classified or unlisted codes should
not be used if specific codes are available. Only exceptions published by Idaho Medicaid are
permitted. While Idaho Medicaid publications may provide guidance on coding requirements
for certain services, staff will not code claims for providers or tell providers how to code
outside of published guidance.
Adequate documentation must be attached to the claim to support the use of the unlisted
code. Documentation should include a definition or description of the item or service, the
need, time, effort and equipment necessary to provide the item or service. If a provider bills
for an unlisted or unspecified code, it is their responsibility to determine if the item or service
it represents meets the requirements of medical necessity as listed in the General Information
and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.

3.3 Modifiers
Modifiers are mandatory in certain circumstances. Refer to the most recent Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT®) Manual for specific guidance using modifiers. Anatomical modifiers are
required when the procedure is unilateral (left arm/right arm). If the procedure is a unilateral
code, and there is no more specific code available as with 28126 (Resection, single toe, each)
or 28153 (Resection, head of phalanx, toe), it may be billed as many times as anatomically
appropriate—for this example, ten times, with use of the appropriate modifier to identify each
toe. This section of the handbook is not inclusive of all modifiers accepted by Idaho Medicaid.

3.3.5 Modifier 22: Increased Procedural Services
Increased procedural services are reported by appending modifier 22 to the usual procedure
code when additional work factors require the physician’s technical skill and involves
significantly increased work, time and complexity. Modifier 22 is not used for Evaluation and
Management (E/M) services.
To request additional Medicaid reimbursement, you must submit the following information
with your claim:
• Operative Report;
• A short narrative explaining why the modifier is appropriate. Examples:
o A great deal of risk and difficulty due to a patient with extreme comorbidities
(listed);
o Technical difficulty of procedure;
o Additional time to complete beyond a normal procedure.
• Note amount of time an uncomplicated procedure would take and the time the modifier
procedure took; and
• Amount or percentage of additional reimbursement you are requesting.

3.3.6 Modifier 24: Unrelated Evaluation and Management
Modifier 24 represents unrelated evaluation and management service by the same physician
or other qualified health care professional during a postoperative period. Modifier 24 is
permissible when the service is:
• Unrelated to the surgical diagnosis;
• A treatment of an underlying condition;
• A complication resulting from the surgery except when it would be included in the
global payment; or
• An added course of treatment which is not part of the normal recovery from surgery.

3.3.7 Modifier 25: Separately Identifiable Service
The global surgical package includes all necessary services normally furnished before
(preoperative), during (intraoperative) and after (postoperative) a procedure by the surgeon
or by members of the same group within the same specialty. The global surgical package
applies to physicians, or qualified non-physician healthcare professionals, services in any
setting, including inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center and
physician office.
Modifier 25 is appended to an evaluation and management (E&M) code when a significant
separately identifiable service is provided by the same physician or other qualified healthcare
professional on the same day of the procedure or other service. E&M performed on the same
date as a minor procedure are usually included in the payment for the procedure regardless
of if the provider performing the E&M and surgeon are different so long as they’re in the same
group. The service provided with a modifier 25 must be unrelated to the decision to have a
surgery. The diagnoses for the E&M and procedure do not have to be different to qualify
separately from the global.

3.3.8 Modifier 50: Bilateral Procedure
Modifier 50 is used for bilateral procedures occurring during the same session. The code is
billed on a single line with the modifier 50 to represent both procedures as a single occurrence.
It is inappropriate to append this modifier to add-on codes or codes that already include
bilateral in their description. Modifier 50 is not used with modifiers RT and LT. Modifier 50 is
valid for professional and facility claims.

3.3.9 Modifier 51: Multiple Surgical Procedures
When multiple surgical procedures or deliveries are performed at the same session by the
same individual, modifier 51 should be applied to any procedure after the first unless
contradicted by the CPT® Manual. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) must also append
modifier 51 to claims for multiple surgical procedures. Modifier 51 is only for use on
professional and ASC claims. It is not used for other facility claims. In the event that the claim
line for the primary procedure is denied, the system will process the next paid claim line as
the primary procedure and ignore modifier 51 for that line’s reimbursement.

3.3.12 Modifier 54: Surgical Care Only
Modifier 54 represents pre-operative and intra-operative care. Modifier 54 should be
appended when the provider has no intention of providing post-operative care. This is
common for surgeries performed in the emergency room. In the event that a provider bills
for a surgery in the emergency room with a modifier 54, and the participant returns to the
provider for post-operative care, the provider may bill a new claim with the same CPT® for
the procedure and Modifier 55. Modifier 54 reimburses the lessor of the provider’s usual and
customary fee or 80% of the Numerical Fee Schedule.

customary charges or the rate on file, whichever is less.
The use of Modifier 58 by an outpatient hospital may represent:
• A procedure performed by the original provider;
• A follow-up surgery more extensive than the original procedure;
• A therapy following a diagnostic surgical procedure; or
• The time frame for the performance of the staged procedure. This may occur during
the postoperative period (i.e., global surgical period) associated with the original
surgery.
Modifier 58 is not intended for use to report a problem that requires a return to the operating
room. These are a component of the global billing for surgeries.

Modifier 59: Separate Encounters and Distinct
3.3.17 Procedures
NCCI Procedure-to-Procedure (PTP) edits with a Correct Coding Modifier Indicator (CCMI) of
“1” allow providers to use modifiers to indicate medical necessity for procedures or services
that would usually not be reported together, but in particular circumstances are appropriate.
Modifier 59 is often inappropriately billed and must be used per the criteria of this section.
The Modifier cannot be used to simply bypass the NCCI edit.
Providers must have documentation supporting the use of Modifier 59. Documentation must
support a different session, different procedure or surgery (i.e., different session or site),
different site or organ system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury
(or area of injury in extensive injuries) not ordinarily encountered or performed on the same
day by the same individual. Contiguous structures in the same organ or anatomic region do
not constitute treatment of different anatomic sites. Services with modifier 59 do not require
a different diagnosis from the conflicting procedure.
Modifier 59 may be used for two timed codes provided in the same session as long as the
services are provided sequentially. There must be a clear end to the services in one code
before services in the other code begin.
Modifier 59 may be used for, but is not limited to, anesthesia services.
Modifier 59 must only be used for a diagnostic procedure which precedes a therapeutic
procedure when the diagnostic is used as a basis to decide to perform the therapeutic
procedure. In order to qualify the diagnostic cannot:
• Overlap with a therapeutic intervention or services required for one;
• Be a service that would otherwise be required for the intervention; or
• Be an inherent component of a surgical procedure.
Modifier 59 must only be used for a diagnostic procedure after a therapeutic procedure when
the diagnostic is not a common or necessary follow-up to the procedure. In order to qualify
the diagnostic cannot:
• Overlap with a therapeutic intervention or services required for one;
• Be a service that would otherwise be required for the intervention; or
• Be an inherent component of a surgical procedure.
If another modifier is appropriate, it must always be used instead of modifier 59. This includes
modifiers that are more anatomically specific, such as RT, LT, F1-F9, etc., and modifiers XE,
XS, XP and XU, which were created to replace most of the functions modifier 59 supplies.
Modifier 59 should never be used for evaluation and management services.

3.3.2 Modifier 76: Repeat Procedure
Modifier 76 (repeat procedure by the same physician) is used for multiple or identical services
provided to a participant on the same day. When billing with modifier 76, the first claim line
with the code should not contain the modifier. The modifier should appear on the subsequent
code. A service repeated multiple times that would be billed with modifier 76 should have all
units after the first unit billed on a single line. The Modifier must not be used to simply bypass
a duplication of service edit.
Example
For three EKGs provided to the participant on the same day the claim lines would be billed:

3.3.7 Modifier JW: Medical Waste of Drugs and Biologicals
The JW modifier is used on Medicare Part B claims with drugs or biologicals from single use
vials and packages. Single-use products are only intended for use by a single patient or
procedure. The modifier is appended on claim lines for units that are not administered to a
patient, and must be discarded as wastage. Wastage is defined as the amount of a drug or
biologic leftover in a vial or package after a portion of the same vial or package is administered
to a Medicaid participant.
Idaho Medicaid covers the wastage of drug or biological products administered by injection or
infusion using the JW modifier for drugs and biologics billed using C, J, Q or S HCPCS codes.
Wastage is only reimbursable for drugs or biologics that only come in a single-use vial or
package as identified by the manufacturer. Drugs that are available in a multi-dose vial or
package are not available for wastage reimbursement. Reimbursement is limited to the
difference between the amount ordered/administered for the participant and the minimum
amount needed to equal the nearest whole vial or package. The nearest whole vial or package
is calculated using the vial or package size and dose that results in the least amount of waste
available on the market. If possible, administered doses should be rounded to the nearest vial
to avoid wastage.
Examples
If the physician orders 100 mg of a drug, and the drug is manufactured in both
a 50 mg single-use vial and a 150 mg single-use vial, then no wastage is
reimbursable as two 50 mg vials meet the amount ordered.
If the physician orders 180 mg of a drug, and the drug is manufactured in both
a 100 mg single-use vial and a 150 mg single-use vial, then Idaho Medicaid will
only reimburse for 20 mg of wastage, the result of using two 100 mg vials. If
the provider only has 150 mg single-use vials on the date of service, 120 mg
will be wasted. However, Idaho Medicaid will still only reimburse for 20 mg of
wastage. The remaining 100 mg of wasted drug is excess wastage that is not
eligible for reimbursement. The 100 mg becomes a business expense or loss
incurred by the provider due to not having the 100 mg vials available when
needed.
Reimbursement is not available for:
• Drugs and biologics in excess of what is ordered and billed without the JW modifier;
• Drugs and biologics in excess of the minimum wastage amount possible per this policy;
• Drugs and biologics available in multi-dose vials or multi-use packages;
• Drugs and biologics discarded due to expiration when no amount of the discarded vial
or pack was administered to the participant;
• Wastage of an amount less than a whole unit of billing per the HCPCS code’s long
description;
• Drugs and biologics in which any portion of the vial or package was administered to a
patient other than the Medicaid participant. This includes another Medicaid participant;
• Drugs and biologics that require a prior authorization for which no prior authorization
was obtained;
• Drugs and biologics included in the encounter rate for Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC);
• Drugs and biologics not purchased by the practice site (e.g. study drugs provided by
the study sponsor and compassionate use programs);
• Medication waste resulting from overfill of the single dose vial;
July 1, 2025 Page 87 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
• Medication waste resulting from a missed/failed patient visit;
• Skin substitutes; and
• Drug and biologic wastage for the same drug or biologic from multiple single-use vials
or packages opened during the same encounter.
The medical record for claims with the JW modifier must contain the following information on
the drug:
• The authorized prescriber order;
o Orders with dosages based on specific measurements such as weight, surface
area, etc., must include those measurements;
• The amount of drug or biologic administered; and
• The amount of drug or biologic discarded or wasted;
o Must include date and time of disposal;
o The reason for disposal; and
o The name, licensure, and signature of the person discarding the drug or
biologic.
Claims for drug or biologic wastage must be billed on the same claim as the administered
portion of the drug. Wastage in compliance with this section is billed on a separate line item
with the modifier JW. The date of service for this claim line must be the last covered
administration according to the plan of care or if the participant dies, the date of death.

3.4 Diagnosis Codes
Idaho Medicaid only accepts diagnosis codes identified in the International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) from the World Health
Organization (WHO). The claims processing system requires all diagnosis on claims codes be
entered with the decimal point. This applies to paper, electronic or online/direct data entry
claims.
Claims should be coded to the highest level of specificity. Unspecified diagnoses codes should
be the exception. Some services are restricted in the provider handbook or posted policies for
specific circumstances as identified by diagnoses codes. If an unspecified code does not
appear on these lists, but is the appropriate diagnoses, check the policy or handbook with the
restriction for instructions on alternate billing options. For example, some policies may allow
claims with a KX modifier for uncovered diagnoses. If alternate billing options aren’t provided:
• For inpatient hospital stays, please, follow Telligen’s default processes.
• For other claims follow the claim review and Medicaid review process.

3.4.2 ICD-10 Updates During Inpatient Stays
If an update to ICD-10 codes becomes effective during an ongoing inpatient stay, providers
should split bill to have the most appropriate diagnosis on each claim.
For example, a participant’s stay is 01/01/2018 to 01/31/2018, and new ICD-10 codes
become effective 01/16/2018. Claim #1 should have the original diagnosis for 01/01/2018 to
01/15/2018. Claim #2 would have the new diagnosis for 01/16/2018 to 01/31/2018.

3.5 National Correct Coding Initiative
The National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) is a program developed by CMS that uses correct
coding methodologies to reduce overpayments to providers due to incorrect coding on claims.
NCCI edits are comprised of Procedure-to-Procedure Edits and Medically Unlikely Edits.
Section 6507 of the Affordable Care Act directed all State Medicaid programs to implement
use of NCCI methodologies that are “compatible” with claims filed with Medicaid. This is to
promote correct coding and control improper coding leading to inappropriate payment of
claims under Medicaid.
Idaho may not override an edit through the prior authorization process. However, an edit may
be overridden through the claim reconsideration and appeals process. The state may seek
an exemption from CMS for an individual code only when the MUE is contrary to state policy,
such as the case where Idaho instructs a provider to bill in 15-minute increments and the
national code description does not designate a time frame for the code.
NCCI edits are updated on a quarterly basis, with new edits added each quarter. For additional
information and instruction as well as lists of current edits, providers should access the
Medicaid NCCI page.

3.5.2 Procedure-to-Procedure (PTP) Edits
Procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits define pairs of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)®
and HCPCS codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons. One reason
a combination may not be allowed is that one code is considered a component of another.
These edits apply to claims with a combination of the same participant, provider and date of
service.

3.5.3 Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE)
Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs), or units-of-service edits, define for each CPT® and HCPCS
code the number of units of service that would be medically necessary for most participants
in most situations. Services that exceed an MUE will be denied. However, if services are
medically necessary beyond the MUE, providers can bill additional units on another claim line
with the SC modifier. This modifier indicates that the provider has reviewed the medical
documentation and determined additional services are medically necessary.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented an outpatient hospital
MUE of zero to any services that should be limited to an inpatient hospital setting to ensure
patient safety. Procedure codes with an MUE of zero for outpatient hospital procedures can
be found at CMS.gov under the National Correct Coding Initiative. Modifiers cannot be used
to override the zero MUE.

4. Claim Submission
Providers may submit claims by:
• Electronic Data Interchange (EDI);
• Direct data entry (DDE) into Health PAS-Online, Trading Partner Account (TPA); and
• By mail on original, preprinted paper claim forms.
Electronic claim submission has many benefits, including a reduced number of errors, faster
payments, and easier claim tracking.
Once a completed claim is submitted it is assigned a claim number. Claim numbers begin with
the two-digit year and three-digit day-of-the-year to denote the date the claim was received.
Claims that are adjusted or reversed will retain the date the original claim was submitted to
ensure compliance with timely filing. Adjusted claims will have an A1 suffix, while reversed
claims will have an R1 suffix.

4.2 Electronic Claims Submission
All providers must register as trading partners with Gainwell Technologies (GWT) via the Idaho
Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. Registration includes electronically signing a trading
partner agreement for HIPAA compliance in order to receive a trading partner ID, which is
used on the X12 transactions as an identifier of the submitting provider.
Registering as a trading partner will also allow you access to the secure portion of the website
for all real time claim entries, inquiries, and status requests. The secure website allows for
ease of access to reports including the remittance advice. Please see the Trading Partner
Account (TPA) User Guide in the User Guides online.
GWT offers two methods for electronic claims submission.
1. EDI is a HIPAA compliant X12 claim transaction referred to as an 837, which is
submitted using online File Exchange upload. For EDI claim submission and billing
instructions, please refer to the appropriate HIPAA X12 Vendor Specifications
Companion Guides located at Health PAS-Online at www.idmedicaid.com. Electronic
claims that are not in the correct HIPAA compliant format will be rejected.
2. DDE is the web-based entry of claims into the Health PAS-Online secure provider
portal.
When billing electronically, providers must complete all HIPAA required data elements;
however, not all of the information is used by Idaho Medicaid in claims processing. The
following HIPAA required data elements for an electronic HIPAA 837 claim submission are not
used by Idaho Medicaid.
• Release of medical data
• Benefit assignment
• Patient signature
• Social Security number
• Tax ID number and qualifier
• Entity type qualifiers
• Provider and participant address
• Participant ID qualifier
• Participant date of birth
• Participant gender

4.2.1 Vendor Software and Clearinghouses
Providers subject to Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) requirements can use EVV software
from any EVV vendor after it is tested and certified as compliant with the MMIS Aggregator
managed by Sandata. Software vendors are not allowed to test their product with Gainwell
Technologies (GWT) Medicaid Solutions. GWT will not endorse any specific software
application. Any testing of third party software must be performed by a registered provider.
Contact the GWT Technical Help Desk if you have any questions regarding this process.
Providers who wish to bill electronically and who bill more than one insurance carrier should
consider using a clearinghouse. Clearinghouses are private companies that handle insurance
claims for multiple carriers. The advantage for the provider is that claims are entered only
once for the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse then forwards the claim to the appropriate
insurance carriers (including Idaho Medicaid). A list of all currently registered Clearinghouses
and Billing Agencies is available on Health PAS-Online by selecting the link titled Registered
Clearinghouses and Billing Agencies. GWT will furnish the specifications, free of charge,
to any vendor upon request. Once the clearinghouse has successfully transmitted enough test
data to become production certified with the MMIS, providers using their services may begin
using the clearinghouse to submit claims.
Since providers use a variety of different billing software brands, it is not possible to give
exact information on how to complete any specific electronic eligibility or claim form. Providers
can review the EDI Companion Guides, available on the Idaho GWT Medicaid website, for a
general example of HIPAA-compliant electronic transaction formats. See the next section for
details about registering as a trading partner to begin testing.

4.3 Paper Claim Forms
Several different types of claim forms are used to bill services to Medicaid. The following forms
are the only paper forms accepted by Idaho Medicaid:
• CMS 1500 (Red drop out form)
• UB-04 (Red drop out form)
All paper claims are electronically scanned for processing. The printed versions of the claim
forms are machine readable which means they are printed using special paper, special color
inks, and within precise specifications. For this reason, only original color forms can be used
for scanning. Forms that cannot be scanned are returned to the provider.
To ensure paper claims are scanned correctly, follow these guidelines:
• Use the specified original claim form referenced above. Photocopies cannot be scanned
and will be returned to the provider.
• Check the Claim Form Instructions;CMS-1500 Instructions or the UB04-Instructions,
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbooks for your specific provider type for the required
fields.
• Do not enter any data or documentation on the claim form not listed as required. When
billing Medicaid there is no need to enter data into fields that are not required.
• Use black ink or a typewriter with a good ribbon or a printer with a good ink cartridge.
Change the ribbon or ink source if the print is too light.
• When using a typewriter or printer, make sure the form is lined up correctly, so it
prints evenly. Claims cannot be processed when the information is not in the correct
field or not within the box. If completing the form by hand, print neatly.
• Be sure to stay within the box for each field.
• When entering an X in a check-off box, be sure that the mark is centered in the box.
• White correction fluid is acceptable, but no other alterations should be made on the
form.
• Do not use bold font.
Do not staple or paper clip any attachments to the claim form. Check the Provider Guidelines
for your specific provider type handbook to see if an attachment is required. Providers have
the option to upload claim attachments through the Idaho Gainwell Technologies Medicaid
website when entering claims through a Trading Partner Account (TPA). Attachments should
be scanned completed forms, word processing, or spreadsheet documents.
If an attachment is required, providers can continue to send claims via US mail. Do not fold
the form. Mail it flat in a 9 x 12 envelope (minimum size).
Mail to the appropriate address found in one of the following tables.

4.4 Attachments
Attachments are additional documentation required to support the processing and payment
of a claim. Please ensure all attachments are legible.
Attachments may include:
• Third Party Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
• Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN)/Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB)
• Certificate of Medical Necessity CMS-484—Oxygen (CMN)
• Pharmacy prescription
• Consent forms
• Manufacturer’s MSRP
• Manufacturer’s invoice showing provider cost and shipping as applicable
If a claim has an attachment, do not staple or clip it to the claim. Place it
behind the claim form, as illustrated in the figure to the left.
If multiple claims refer to the same attachment, then make separate copies
of the attachment for each claim.
If multiple claims are sent together, then stack the claims with each claim
followed by its own attachment(s). See the diagram at left.
If an attachment has information on both sides of the page, then make a copy of the backside
and include it with the claim.
If an attachment such as a sales receipt is on a small slip of paper, then copy or tape it onto
an 8 ½” by 11” inch piece of paper.
If the submission is related to timely filing, it is required that you attach the Medicaid RA. If
the submission is a claim review request or the like, attaching the RA will help explain the
history of the claim and previous processing.
If no attachments are required, then consider submitting the claim electronically.

4.5 Claim Status
Gainwell Technologies (GWT) has 30-days from the date of submission to render an initial
disposition on a claim. Providers can determine the status of their claims through Gainwell
Technologies in four ways:
• Through the weekly Remittance Advice (RA). See Remittance Advice Analysis, Idaho
Medicaid Provider Handbook for information on RAs.
• Calling Medicaid Automated Customer Service (MACS) at 1 (866) 686-4272.
• The electronic claim status request and response transaction (HIPAA 276/277).
• Online through the Gainwell Technologies Idaho Medicaid website.
Questions specific to a claim in a denied status must use the secure messaging option through
the provider’s trading partner account.
MACS Inquiry: Providers can check the status of electronic and paper claims sent to Gainwell
Technologies for processing by calling MACS and selecting the claims information option. For
more information on how to access MACS and check claim status, refer to the MACS User
Guide in the User Guides on the Idaho GWT Medicaid website.
Electronic Inquiry: Idaho Medicaid supports the HIPAA transaction known as the 276/277,
Electronic Claim Status Inquiry and Response. This transaction allows providers to inquire
on the status of claims and health plans to return the requested information. Providers should
contact their software vendor or clearinghouse to determine if their vendor supports the
claim status inquiry and response transactions.
Online Inquiry: This option is available to providers who have a trading partner account.
More information about verifying eligibility online can be found in the Eligibility
Verification section of the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide.
Potential claim statuses include:
• DENY: The claim or claim line has been denied for reimbursement. A remittance
message will be included with more information on why.
• PAY: The claim line is approved to pay.
• PEND: The claim requires manual review by a Claims Resolution Specialist, and
will change to a PAY or DENY status once completed.

Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
5. Adjustments
Adjustments are permitted on a claim only if the information on the original claim is updated.
Adjustments cannot be used to add additional services or units, or change the date of service
or billed charges. If the claim requires additional line items, or changes to the initial date of
service, a new claim is required. Providers have two (2) years from the start date of service
to adjust a claim except for institutional claims and Medicare crossover claims. Institutional
claims have two (2) years from the through date of service. Medicare crossover claims have
two (2) years from the date of the Medicare Remittance Notice. Documentation should be
included to support timely filing. In accordance with the provider agreement, providers are
required to immediately repay identified overpayments.
For claims that are under two (2) years old from the applicable date, providers must adjust
their own claims via an EDI 837 transaction or through their Trading Partner Account (TPA).
For those providers who do not have the capability to use either method, a Claim Review
Request Form must be submitted stating in the Comments field why the provider is unable
to adjust the claim electronically; additionally, the provider must also request the claim be
reversed, and include a new modified claim form with the Claim Review Request Form, located
on the Forms page of Gainwell Technologies’ (GWT’s) Idaho Medicaid website.
For providers seeking to adjust claims that are beyond two (2) years old from the applicable
date, it is considered a recoupment. For these claims, you must refund via check for both
partial and complete recoupments and include the Overpayment Form located on the Forms
page of GWT’s Idaho Medicaid website.
The Remittance Advice (RA) will show any adjustments made. For more information on an RA
see the Remittance Advice Analysis, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.

5.2 Electronic Adjustments
Providers can submit electronic adjustments to Gainwell Technologies using Health PAS-
Online or their vendor software. Attachments can be submitted via EDI and attachments are
necessary to support and explain the adjustment. Please see the Claim Status section of the
Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide for instructions. When submitting electronic
adjustments, use claim frequency 8 to void a claim or claim frequency 7 to replace a claim.
5.3 Paper Adjustments
When a claim is paid incorrectly, resubmit a completed claim form indicating the original claim
number and claim frequency code. If resubmitting on a CMS 1500, the frequency code of
eight (8) to void a claim, or claim frequency seven (7) to replace a claim is placed in
Field/Box 22 along with the original claim number. If resubmitting on a UB-04 claim form,
the last digit of the bill type is considered the frequency code. In Field/Box 4, the bill type
must show a seven (7) or eight (8) in the frequency position and the original claim number
in Field/Box 64. See the Claim Form Instructions for detailed information.

6. Claim Reconsideration and Appeals
Claim reconsideration and appeals follow this process:
• Step 1: Claim Review Request;
• Step 2: Medicaid Review of Claim Determination;
• Step 3: Formal Appeal.
July 1, 2025 Page 115 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
6.1 Claim Review Request
The Claim Review Request (CRR) process is available to providers who want Gainwell
Technologies (GWT) to physically review their claims. CRRs must be submitted within two (2)
years of the date of service, or the through date for facility claims. A CRR is used when:
• The provider disagrees with a timely filing denial.
• The provider disagrees with the application of Coordination of Benefits (COB).
• The provider disagrees with the denial or payment amount of a claim and wants a
manual review.
• The claim denied for bundling issues against a denied claim line.
• The claim was inappropriately denied as a duplicate claim.
• The claim was inappropriately denied for exceeding a lifetime benefit.
• A condition on the Hospital-Acquired Conditions was not caused by a lack of
appropriate care or inappropriate treatment.
• A claim for delivering a newborn is denied for a participant under the age of 13.
• A claim was submitted for organ donor costs for a deceased Medicaid participant.
• A participant lost eligibility in the middle of a covered stay and then resumed eligibility.
• A revenue code and CPT®/HCPCS combination is not in the claims processing system.
While CRRs can be used for many reasons but should not be used in these instances:
• The claim needs to be adjusted or additional documentation attached. Examples of
documents include: Explanation of Benefits (EOB), invoice, sterilization/hysterectomy
consent forms, NOA for timely filing, or run/trip report.
• The provider has concerns with Share of Cost (SOC).
• The provider wants more information on Health Management Systems (HMS)
adjustments or recoupments.
• The provider wants to request recoupment for a claim within the two (2) year
adjustment period.
• The provider is adjusting a claim after a change in the participant’s eligibility.
It is best practice for providers to use the provider portal to reverse and adjust claims when
necessary, to attach documentation, or reprocess the claim, especially in the instances noted
above when a CRR is not used. Please reference the section titled Reverse or Adjust a Claim
in the Trading Partner Account (TPA) User Guide for more information on navigating the
provider portal. For overpayments, see Adjustments.
The CRR instructions and form are found on GWT’s website under the Reference Material tab
under Forms – Gainwell Technologies Forms. Check Claim Review Request on the Claim
Review Request Form and complete the necessary information. The form must be completed
in blue or black ink and follow all instructions for it to be processed. Attach only documents
pertinent to the request. Do not attach the full medical record as this may be a HIPAA
violation. Some of the information required on the form includes:
• Most current claim ID requiring review
• Provider information
• Participant information
• Comments – any explanation needed to help in review
• Attachments – any attachments pertinent to the claim and that helps support the
request as well as any additional required documentation (such as a corrected or
replacement claim, EOB with remark codes, timely filing, medical records, chart notes,
or reports).
Medicaid does not accept CRRs via e-mail or fax. All requests must be mailed. Mail the Claim
Review Request Form and attachments to:

P. O. Box 70082
Boise, ID 83707
Providers requesting more than five (5) CRRs to Gainwell for reconsideration are encouraged
to contact a Provider Relations Consultant (PRC) first for assistance with the denial. The PRC
can help the provider ensure the CRR process is the most efficient way for resolution of the
claim. More information about PRCs is found in the General Information and Requirements for
Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook.

7. Third Party Liability
This section covers the Third-Party Liability (TPL) situations applicable to providers working with
Idaho Medicaid participants. It briefly describes how Gainwell Technologies (GWT) processes
TPR claims. In accordance with Federal regulations 42 CFR-433.135-139, the Division of
Medicaid or its designee must take all reasonable measures to determine the legal liability of
third parties to pay for medical services under the plan.
A third party is any insurance company, private individual, corporation, or business that can
be held legally responsible for the payment of all or part of the medical or dental costs of a
participant. Third parties could include:
• Medicare;
• Group health insurance;
• Workers’ compensation;
• Homeowners’ or renters’ insurance;
• Automobile liability insurance;
• Non-custodial parents and/or their insurance carriers; or
• An individual found legally responsible for a Medicaid participant’s injury (a person who
committed an assault on a participant, for instance).
Federal regulations require providers to bill all known insurance companies before submitting
a claim to Medicaid. At this time, services federally excluded from TPR requirements are:
• Indian Health Services (IHS);
• Purchased or Referred Care (PRC) healthcare by IHS;
• Health insurance plans self-funded by a federally recognized tribe;
• School-based services;
• Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) or the crime victim’s compensation programs;
• The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP); and
• Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and testing (EPSDT) services, when a liable
third party has not made payment within 90 days after the date the provider of such
services initially submitted a claim to such third party for payment for such services,
in accordance with section 1902(a)(25)(E) of the Social Security Act. Screening and
diagnosis program services include:
o Age-appropriate exams, including comprehensive health and developmental
history, growth, development, and nutritional status, provided in accordance
with reasonable standards of medical and dental practice;
o Medically necessary behavioral health services;
o Immunizations;
o Laboratory tests; and
o Diagnosis of defects of vision, hearing, dental needs, and other health
conditions for participants under the age of 21.
Based on these regulatory requirements, Idaho Medicaid is the primary payer for the following
third-party insurers:
• 6243 SHASTA ADMIN SERVICES-INDIAN HEALTH
• 6233 HEALTHCARE MGT ADMIN - AN/AI
Services for treatment of individuals under the age of 21 are not excluded from TPL
requirements except where noted.
The provider must accept the Medicaid allowed amount as payment in full. The provider
cannot bill the participant for any balance remaining after the primary insurance and Medicaid
have both paid. This also includes claims with third-party liability where Medicaid’s
July 1, 2025 Page 120 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
reimbursement methodology considers the third-party payment to have covered the claim in
full and no additional amount is paid by Medicaid. See the Participant Financial Responsibility
section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbook for when billing a participant is allowed.

7.3 Coordination of Benefits (COB)
Coordination of Benefits (COB) is how Idaho Medicaid determines payment for claims when a
third-party is liable for a portion of the charges. The COB calculation is performed at the claim
level for all claims to determine the payment for claims with a third-party insurer. COB
calculation is not performed line by line. COB amounts entered at the claim detail level are
summed up for the claim and then the COB calculation is performed. The payment is then
distributed to the claim detail lines.
The Department is not liable for penalties levied against a provider by a third-party payor.
Any amount deducted from a payor’s reimbursement for a penalty will not be included in the
COB calculation. For example, if Medicare decreases reimbursement on a claim due to a
penalty, the amount used in the COB calculation is what Medicare would have reimbursed if
no penalty was applied.
Third Party Recovery claims are claims that HMS has recovered payment on from a
participant’s primary insurance payer, who was unknown at the time the original claim was
paid. The amount HMS recovered from the other payer is reflected as a primary insurance
payment amount on the Remittance Advice and provider portal. An eligibility segment will be
displayed reflecting either Third Party Recovery or Casualty for participants on the portal.
Claims marked as Casualty indicate a settlement has been reached in an accident case and
the claim is finalized; these claims cannot be adjusted any longer. Claims marked as Third
Party Recovery indicate that the Department received funds from a primary insurance carrier;
these claims can be adjusted, but the recovery amount will remain with the claim for historical
purposes, regardless of what is updated by the provider.
All claims are priced in one (1) of four (4) ways when determining coordination of benefits:
1. Member Responsibility
Add together the primary’s coinsurance, co-payment, and deductible. If no
coinsurance, co-payment, and/or deductible are reported, then the payment is zero.
Claims paid with this method:
• Medicare Part A
• Hospital Inpatient (Unless primary was not active the full length of the stay.)
• QMB-Only participants

Provider Billed Amount: $100.00
Primary Ins Allowed Amount: $80.00
Primary Ins Paid Amount: $64.00
Primary Ins Deductible: $0.00

Whichever is the lesser of:
Add together the primary’s coinsurance, co-payment, and deductible. If there is no
reported coinsurance, co-payment, and/or deductible, then the payment is zero
(Member Responsibility). For commercial claims, if there is no reported coinsurance,
co-payment, and/or deductible, then the payment follows Medicaid-Allowed Minus
Primary Insurance Payment.

Important note: It is necessary to report the Medicare/Other Insurance allowed, paid,
deductible, coinsurance, and co-payment amounts accurately for correct payment
consideration.
Professional Claims
Medicaid’s payment for services will be calculated according to the Lesser Of methodology.
The payment will be the lesser of the primary insurance’s co-insurance, co-payment, and
deductible, or the primary’s insurance payment subtracted from the Medicaid allowed amount.
When the Medicaid allowed amount is less than COB paid, the payment is zero.
Hospital Claims – Inpatient
Medicaid’s payment for services are usually calculated according to the Member Responsibility
methodology. If no co-insurance, co-payment, or deductible are reported the payment is
zero. However, if the primary insurance was not active for the entire inpatient stay, the
payment for services will be the lesser of the provider’s charge minus the primary insurance
payment, or the primary’s insurance payment subtracted from the Medicaid allowed amount.
Hospital Claims – Outpatient
July 1, 2025 Page 128 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
Medicaid’s payment for services are calculated according to the Lesser Of methodology. When
the Medicaid allowed amount is less than COB paid, the payment is zero. When Medicare
reports zero for non-covered services, then DHW processes claims as Primary and pays the
Medicaid allowed amount.
Professional Claims for Medicare Non-covered Service
Medicaid’s payment for services are calculated according to the Lesser Of methodology. When
the Medicaid allowed amount is less than COB paid, the payment is zero. When Medicare
reports zero for non-covered services, then DHW processes claims as Primary and pays the
Medicaid allowed amount.
Long Term Care Facility
Medicaid’s payment for services are calculated according to the Medicaid-Allowed Amount
Minus Primary Insurance Payment methodology. Then minus any unpaid Share of Cost (SOC)
amount. When the Medicaid allowed amount is less than COB paid, the payment is zero.
FQHC/RHC/IHC
Medicaid’s payment for services are calculated according to the Medicaid-Allowed Amount
Minus Primary Insurance Payment methodology. When the Medicaid allowed amount is less
than COB paid, the payment is zero.

7.4 Submitting Third Party Liability Claims
The claim must be submitted correctly to the responsible third party before it may be
submitted to Medicaid. After receiving either a partial payment or a denial from an
insurance company, submit the claim to Medicaid for payment consideration along with a
copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) including the information for the claim and the
explanation of the remark codes. Do not wait to submit claims to Medicaid if doing so would
cause the claim to be denied for timely filing. See the Timely Filing Limit section for more
information.
A billing or timeliness error is not considered a valid denial for the purposes of satisfying the
requirement to bill all other insurances. The following are examples of denials that are not
accepted for paper, online, or electronic claims:
• Claim lacks information needed for adjudication;
• Prior Authorization required;
• Patient cannot be identified as our insured;
• Claim filed past filing time limit; and
• Duplicate of a previously submitted claim.
When submitting the claim to Medicaid, verify that the dates of service, units, detail charges,
and total charges are the same on the primary insurance EOB and on the claim to Medicaid.
If the other insurance carrier denied the claim, submit the claim to Gainwell Technologies
(GWT) for processing. A copy of the other insurance company’s EOB (both detail about the
claim and an explanation of the remark codes) must be attached to the claim to document
the other insurance company’s denial. The denial must be validated before the claim can be
processed by GWT. The following types of documentation are not acceptable as EOBs:
• Screen prints of primary insurance system, or an internal system;
• Word documents;
• Eligibility inquiries;
• Claim inquiries; or
• Claim rejection notices.
A paper EOB from the other insurer is included with paper claims, including the EOB claim
resolution message from the other insurance and the explanation of any remark codes. Since
there are hundreds of insurers, each with their own remark coding system, Idaho Medicaid
cannot process a claim unless the EOB number and message is included with the paper
claim.
Fill in the other insurance paid amount in the appropriate field of the claim. If the insurance
pays at zero, 0.00 must be recorded in the appropriate field or the claim will be denied.
These claims must be submitted to Medicaid with the EOB attached.
When some of the services were paid by the liable third-party and others denied, the claim
must be split between the paid and the denied services on separate claim forms along with
the EOB.
If you receive notification or a claim rejection notice that your member has lost primary
insurance coverage from the carrier please contact HMS at P.O. Box 94630, Seattle, WA
98124-6930, or by phone at 1 (800) 873-5875. A member’s primary insurance record must
be verified as inactive before the claims processing system can be updated and claims can be
paid.

7.4.2 Electronic Third-Party Claims
HIPAA Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC) replace the third-party Explanation of
Benefits (EOB) codes that were formerly used on both paper and electronic third-party claims.
They explain how the claim was processed and give additional information about the payment
of benefits or denial of the claim by the third-party payer.
For electronic/EDI claims, the current RARC(s) are required on all TPR transactions. For paper
claims and online entry claims, attach the required EOB(s) from the other insurance(s); these
EOB(s) would also use the same RARC.
The RARC are updated three times a year by CMS. A current list of the RARC codes can be
found on the X12 website.
Further information can also be obtained online at the Idaho Gainwell Technologies’ Medicaid
website, or by contacting Provider Services at 1 (866) 686-4272.

7.4.4 Split Claims
Sometimes claims are billed to other insurance companies with more lines than will fit on the
Medicaid paper claim form. To create a matching claim, the claim must be split.
If the other insurance’s Explanation of Benefits (EOB) has more detail lines than will fit on the
claim form, divide the claim into two or more separate claims. Submit the first lines on one
claim form and the remaining lines on additional claim forms. Write Split Claim in Field/Box
19 of the CMS-1500 claim form, or Field/Box 80 of the UB-04 claim form. Total each claim.
Pro-rate the third-party payments to match the lines billed Attach a separate copy of the EOB
to each split claim.
When billing electronically, it is not necessary to split a claim unless the provider is submitting
more than the maximum number of detail lines allowed on the claim.
• Professional claims: Up to 50 details
• Institutional claims: Up to 999 details
Claims must also be split between paid and denied services.
Note: ICD-10-CM codes S00 to T88.9 are injury diagnoses. For more on using diagnosis codes
in this range see section, Injury Liability, before submitting your claim. This helps prevent an
unnecessary claim denial.

7.5 Claims for Participants with Medicare
Providers must enroll with the Idaho Medicaid Program separately from Medicare. When the
participant is dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare must be billed first. Claims
submitted to Medicare electronically crossover to Medicaid. Claims that fail to automatically
cross over from Medicare must be submitted to Medicaid with a Medicare Remittance Notice
(MRN) attached. The MRN must include the Medicare payment or non-payment reason code.
If the MRN does not clearly identify that it is an MRN, write on the top right margin of the
claim or the MRN, ”Medicare MRN” or ”Medicare HMO”
, if applicable to help sort the claim.
Medicare Excluded Services do not require a MRN to be considered by Medicaid. If the
participant’s coverage is handled through a private insurance carrier that is not Medicare,
then the provider must submit an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the primary insurance.
When Medicare is the primary carrier for payment, the Idaho Medicaid authorization
requirements do not apply. Medicare guidelines are followed. If Medicare denies the claim,
Idaho Medicaid becomes the primary payer and Idaho Medicaid’s prior authorization,
documentation, processing, and payment rules apply.
Claims for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB; rate code 68) are eligible for reimbursement
as described under the Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries section.
See the General Information and Requirements for Providers, Idaho Medicaid Provider
Handbook for information related to the different kinds of Medicare and Medicaid coverage a
participant may have. A participant’s Medicare Part A and Part B information is available by
calling the Medicaid Automated Customer Services (MACS) line at 1 (866) 686-4272 and
choosing the other insurance menu option.
July 1, 2025 Page 135 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
7.5.1 Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries
Participants enrolled only as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB; rate code 68) are not
eligible for Medicaid benefits. Services denied or not covered by Medicare for QMB participants
are denied when billed to Medicaid. Claims submitted with both Medicare covered and
Medicare non-covered services on the same claim are denied. The provider must split bill
both covered and non-covered services. The exception to this rule is Medicare excluded
services or when the provider reports modifiers GY or GZ on a Medicare non-covered service
for which they expect no payment from Idaho Medicaid. Excluded services are those that
Medicare never pays for, vs. non-covered, which Medicare may pay in certain circumstances.
These claims are only eligible for the Member Responsibility portion across all provider types.
Member Responsibility is calculated by adding together the primary payers’ coinsurance, co-
payment, and deductible. If no coinsurance, co-payment, and/or deductible are reported,
then the Medicaid payment is zero.
Claims filed secondary to Medicare and sent electronically by Medicare are called crossover
claims. On the Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN) the payment of these charges appears on
the first detail line of the paid claim on the Professional Crossover Claims page. Each claim
form must be submitted with an MRN attached. All claims submitted online or on paper must
match the MRN exactly.

7.5.2 Medicare Advantage
To ensure the claim is processed correctly, claim forms must be filled out completely. If the
Explanation of Benefits (EOB) does not designate Medicare Advantage, specify which plan is
indicated in box 9D or 11C on the CMS-1500. On the UB-04, indicate the plan in box 50.
July 1, 2025 Page 137 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
7.5.3 Split Claims
Claims will deny if submitted with both Medicare covered and Medicare non-covered services
on the same claim. Providers must split bill these services.
An exception to this rule is when modifier GY and/or GZ are reported for Medicare non-covered
services. These services can be billed on the same claim with a Medicare covered service.
Sometimes claims are billed to Medicare with more lines than will fit on the paper claim form.
To create a matching paper claim, the claim must be split. When the Medicare Remittance
Notice (MRN) has more detail lines than will fit on the claim form, split the claim. Submit two
claims with the first lines on one claim form and the remaining lines on additional claim forms.
Write Split Claim in Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form or in Field/Box 80 of the
UB-04 claim form. Leave the fields for amount paid and balance due blank. Attach a separate
copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to each split claim. Total each claim.
When billing electronically, it is not necessary to split a claim unless submitting more than the
maximum number of details allowed on one (1) claim.
• Professional claims: Up to 50 details
• Institutional claims: Up to 999 details

7.5.4 Electronic Crossover Claims
Medicare Part B services billed by Idaho providers cross over electronically from the Medicare
carrier to Gainwell Technologies. This process occurs automatically when the Medicare claim
shows:
• Assignment was accepted
• Participant’s Idaho MID number
• Provider’s Medicare number
Providers may submit claims for Part B services directly to Idaho Medicaid.
July 1, 2025 Page 139 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
7.5.5 Paper Claims for Dually Eligible Participants
Information on dually eligible fee-for-service claims submitted on paper must match the
information on the MRN exactly. The dates of service and dollar amounts must be the same
as those on the MRN. File a separate claim for each claim on the MRN. Participants with both
Medicare and private insurance must have an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from both carriers
attached to the Medicaid claim form.
When billing paper claims for dually eligible participants:
• Use the participant’s MID number.
• Use the Idaho Medicaid provider number.
• Fill in fields required on standard Medicaid claims.
• Sign and date all claims.
• Attach the MRN to the claim and ensure that the MRN is clearly identified as Medicare,
Medicare HMO, or Medicare Supplement on the claim form or MRN; include any
explanations of the remark code(s).
• Ensure all attachments are on 8 1/2" x 11" paper.
When the participant is not Medicaid eligible for a certain date of service, do not enter those
charges on the claim. Enter a note on the front of the claim explaining that this is why the
MRN does not match the claim.
July 1, 2025 Page 140 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
7.5.6 Crossover Errors
Occasionally, a claim from Medicare does not automatically crossover to Gainwell
Technologies (GWT). This occurs when the Medicare and Medicaid participant numbers on file
do not match. If a claim does not appear on the Medicaid remittance advice (RA) within four
weeks after Medicare payment, submit a claim to Medicaid for processing. Call GWT’s Provider
Enrollment at 1 (866) 686-4272 to verify that all provider numbers are on file to allow for
automatic crossover.
Medicaid claims must be submitted within 6 months of the payment date of the Medicare EOB.
July 1, 2025 Page 141 of 153
Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook General Billing Instructions
7.5.7 Resubmitting Crossover Claims
Claims for dually eligible in fee-for-service which are returned to the provider by Medicare for
any reason must be resubmitted as a Medicaid claim. Attach the original claim and any other
supporting documentation to a copy of the Medicare Remittance Notice (MRN). Include both
your provider number and the participant’s Medicaid identification (MID) number.
The claim dates of service, billed amounts and the MRN must match. Occasionally, Medicare
combines or splits claims to expedite processing. When this happens, change the Medicaid
claim form to match the MRN. The services Medicare processes as a single claim under one
claim number must match exactly the service billed on the claim submitted to Medicaid, with
the exception as noted in the Hospital, Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook section for
Emergency Department/Rooms and Observation.
Lab services are usually paid at 100% of the approved amounts. The claim total differs from
the total billed on the MRN if you do not bill these charges to Medicaid. Adding a notation on a
claim (Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form) stating that the lab charges were paid
reduces the chance of a claim being returned in error.

7.6 Injury Liability
All claims submitted with a diagnosis indicating an injury are reviewed for possible liability
recoveries. Claims are still subject to timely filing requirements. Include all documentation
regarding the injury with the claim or on the electronic claim record, even if there are several
claims for the same injury. Claims are reviewed separately and each stands on its own merit.
All possible third party involvement must be investigated for injury liability. The participant
should be contacted for information about the circumstances of the injury. If investigation
reveals no third party liability or shows the claim is not accident related, submit the claim to
Medicaid with information regarding attempts made to identify a third party or obtain accident
information. The information must demonstrate that at least three attempts were made.
Document the person(s) to whom the provider spoke, date and time of the contacts.
In the event that the participant receives a payout directly from a third-party to cover their
medical costs, the provider may bill the participant up to the amount of the direct payout.
This would be reported on a claim as being received from the primary insurer.
To prevent a claim from being denied for additional information, providers should submit
letters of denial; maximums met, no liability, or other documentation, with the claim. Indicate
in Field/Box 19 of the CMS-1500 claim form, or Field/Box 80 of the UB-04 claim form the
following information:
• How the injury occurred;
• If the injury is not accident related;
• Where the injury occurred (home, someone else’s home, work, commercial property,
auto, etc.);
• Date the injury occurred;
• Dates, times and names of person contacted for information, if applicable; and
• Name and phone number of the attorney, if applicable.
See Coordination of Benefits for information about claims that have already had third-party
liability collected.

7.6.2 Injury Liability: Inpatient Coordination of Benefits
For inpatient claims with payments from a Third Party Liability payer:
• In the total allowed amount field enter the Medicaid allowed amount; and
• In the co-insurance field enter the difference between the Medicaid allowed amount
and the Third Party Liability payer amount that was received in order to accurately
calculate Medicaid reimbursement. For example:
Coordination of Benefits (COB)
Total Allowed Amount Medicaid Allowed Amount
Total Paid Amount Payment from Third Party Liability payer
Total Deductible Amount $0.00
Total Coinsurance Amount Medicaid Allowed Amount – Payment from Third Party Liability
payer
Total Co-payment Amount $0.00

7.6.3 Litigation Cases
When an injury claim is in litigation or may go to litigation the provider must choose one of
the following options:
Option One: Submit the claim to Medicaid
Medicaid will pay up to the allowed amount for the services billed. The provider agrees to
accept what Medicaid paid as payment in full. The provider is prohibited from submitting those
same charges for reimbursement in the litigation. The provider cannot later refund Medicaid
and accept a payment from litigation.
Option Two: Pursue payment through litigation
The provider forgoes payment from Medicaid. The provider collects payment from the
participant up to a maximum of what they received through litigation. Regardless of the
litigation’s outcome, the provider may not bill Medicaid or the Medicaid participant for those
services.
