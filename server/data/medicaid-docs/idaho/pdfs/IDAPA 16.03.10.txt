The Department will evaluate provider reimbursement rates that comply with 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A). This
evaluation will assure payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and safeguards against
unnecessary utilization of care and services. Reimbursements will be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care
and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general
population in the geographic area. (4-4-13)

indirect general and administrative costs in the reimbursement methodology, when these costs are incurred by a
provider. The Department will conduct cost surveys customized for each of the services defined in Section 038 of
these rules. (4-4-13)
a. Wage rates will be used in the reimbursement methodology when the expenditure is incurred by the
provider type executing the program. Wages will be identified in the Bureau of Labor Statistics website at
www.bls.gov when there is a comparable occupation title for the direct care staff. When there is no comparable
occupation title for the direct care staff, then a weighted average hourly rate methodology will be used. (4-4-13)
b. For employer related expenditures: (4-4-13)
i. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’s report for employer costs per hour worked for employee
compensation and costs as a percent of total compensation for Mountain West Divisions will be used to determine the
incurred employer related costs by each provider type. The website for access to this report is at www.bls.gov.
 (4-4-13)
ii. The Internal Revenue Service employer cost for social security benefit and Medicare benefit will
be used to determine the incurred employer related costs by provider type. The website for access to this information
is at www.irs.gov. (4-4-13)

220. NURSING FACILITY.
The Enhanced Plan Benefit includes nursing facilities services permitted under Section 1905(a)(4)(A) of the Social
Security Act. These services include nursing facilities services (other than services in an institution for mental
diseases) for individuals determined to be in need of such care. (3-19-07)
221. (RESERVED)
222. NURSING FACILITY SERVICES: ELIGIBILITY.
Entitlement to medical assistance participation in the cost of long-term care exists when the individual is eligible for
medical assistance and the Department has determined that the individual meets the criteria for nursing facility
services. Entitlement must be determined prior to authorization of payment for such care for an individual who is
either a participant of or an applicant for medical assistance. (4-2-08)
01. Criteria for Determination. The criteria for determining a medical assistance participant's need
for nursing facility care is described in Section 223. In addition, the Inspection of Care/Utilization Control (IOC/UC)
nurse must determine whether a medical assistance participant's needs could be met by alternatives other than
residing in a nursing facility, such as an independent living arrangement or residing in a room and board situation.
 (3-19-07)
a. The participant can select any certified facility to provide the care required. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 223 Page 38
b. The final decision as to the level of care required by a medical assistance participant must be made
by the IOC/UC Nurse. (3-19-07)
c. The final decision as to the need for developmental disability (DD) or mental illness (MI) active
treatment must be made by the appropriate Department staff as a result of the Level II screening process. (3-19-07)
d. No payment will be made by the Department on behalf of any eligible medical assistance
participant to any long-term care facility which, in the judgment of the IOC/UC Team, is admitting individuals for
care or services which are beyond the facility's licensed level of care or capability. (3-19-07)
02. Authorization of Long-Term Care Payment. If it has been determined that a person eligible for
medical assistance is entitled to medical assistance participation in the cost of long-term care, and that the facility
selected by the participant is licensed and certified to provide the level of care the participant requires, the Field
Office will forward to such facility an “Authorization for Long-Term Care Payment” form HW 0459. (3-19-07)
223. NURSING FACILITY: CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING NEED.
The participant requires nursing facility level of care when an adult meets one (1) of the Resource Utilization Group
(RUG III) classifications or when a child meets one (1) or more of the criteria described in Subsections 223.02,
223.03, 223.04 or 223.05 of this rule. A child is an individual from age zero (0) through eighteen (18) years; an adult
is an individual more than eighteen (18) years of age. (4-2-08)
01. Required Assessment for Adults. A standard assessment will be approved by the Department for
all adults requesting services with requirements for nursing facility level of care. The Department will specify the
instrument to be used. (4-2-08)
02. Supervision Required for Children. Where the inherent complexity of a service prescribed by the
physician is such that it can be safely and effectively performed only by or under the supervision of a licensed nurse
or licensed physical or occupational therapist. (3-19-07)
03. Preventing Deterioration for Children. Skilled care is needed to prevent, to the extent possible,
deterioration of the child's condition or to sustain current capacities, regardless of the restoration potential of a child,
even where full recovery or medical improvement is not possible. (3-19-07)
04. Specific Needs for Children. When the plan of care, risk factors, and aggregate of health care
needs is such that the assessments, interventions, or supervision of the child necessitates the skills of a licensed nurse
or a licensed physical therapist or licensed occupational therapist. In such cases, the specific needs or activities must
be documented by the physician's orders, progress notes, plan of care, and nursing and therapy notes. (3-19-07)
05. Nursing Facility Level of Care for Children. Using the criteria found in Subsections 223.02,
223.03, and 223.04 of these rules, plus consideration of the developmental milestones, based on the age of the child,
the Department's RMS will determine nursing facility level of care. (4-2-08)
06. Conditions of Payment. (3-19-07)
a. As a condition of payment by the Department for long-term care on behalf of medical assistance
participants, each fully licensed long-term care facility is to be under the supervision of an administrator who is
currently licensed under the laws of the state of Idaho and in accordance with the rules of the Bureau of Occupational
Licenses. (3-19-07)
b. Payment by the Department for the cost of long-term care excludes the date of the participant’s
discharge, unless the day of discharge occurs on the same day as admission; then, one (1) day of care is deemed to
exist. When a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, the date of death is covered, regardless of the time of death.
 (3-21-12)
224. NURSING FACILITY: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME.
Where an individual is determined eligible for medical assistance participation in the cost of his long term care, the
Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facility by the amount of his income considered available
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 225 Page 39
to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.05, “Eligibility for Aid to
the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD),” Sections 721 through 726. The amount which the medical assistance
participant receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare)
is not considered income for patient liability under IDAPA 16.03.05, “Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and
Disabled (AABD),” Section 317. (3-19-07)
225. NURSING FACILITY: COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS.
An institution must provide, on a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals; who because of their
mental or physical condition require care and services above the level of room, board, and supervision. (3-19-07)

 (3-4-11)
02. Skilled Services. Skilled services include services which could qualify as either skilled nursing or
skilled rehabilitative services, which include: (3-19-07)
a. Overall management and evaluation of the care plan. The development, management, and
evaluation of a resident's care plan, based on the physician's orders, constitute skilled services when, in terms of the
patient's physical or mental condition, such development, management, and evaluation necessitate the involvement of
technical or professional personnel to meet his needs, promote his recovery, and assure his medical safety. This would
include the management of a plan involving only a variety of personal care services where, in light of the patient's
condition, the aggregate of such services necessitates the involvement of technical or professional personnel. Where
the patient's overall condition would support a finding that his recovery and safety could be assured only if the total
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 226 Page 40
care he requires is planned, managed, and evaluated by technical or professional personnel, it would be appropriate to
infer that skilled services are being provided. (3-19-07)
b. Observation and assessment of the resident's changing condition. When the resident's condition is
such that the skills of a licensed nurse or other technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate
the patient's need for possible modification of treatment and the initiation of additional medical procedures until his
condition is stabilized, such services constitute skilled services. (3-19-07)
03. Direct Skilled Nursing Services. Direct skilled nursing services include the following: (3-19-07)
a. Intravenous injections; intravenous feedings; intramuscular or subcutaneous injection required on
more than one (1) shift; (3-19-07)
b. Nasopharyngeal feedings; (3-19-07)

04. Direct Skilled Rehabilitative Services. Direct skilled rehabilitative services include the following:
 (3-19-07)
a. Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential, services concurrent with the
management of a resident's care plan, including tests and measurements of range of motion, strength, balance,
coordination, endurance, functional ability, activities of daily living, perceptual deficits, speech and language or
hearing disorders; (3-19-07)
b. Therapeutic exercises or activities which, because of the type of exercises employed or the
condition of the resident, must be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist or
occupational therapist to ensure the safety of the resident and the effectiveness of the treatment; (3-19-07)
c. Gait evaluation and training furnished by a physical or occupational therapist to restore function in
a resident whose ability to walk has been impaired by neurological, muscular, or skeletal abnormality; and (3-19-07)
d. Ultrasound, short-wave, and microwave therapy treatments by a licensed physical therapist.
 (3-19-07)
05. Other Treatment and Modalities. Other treatment and modalities which include hot pack,
hydroculator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, and whirlpool, in cases where the resident's condition is complicated
by circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open wounds, fractures, or other complications, and the skills,
knowledge, and judgement of a licensed physical therapist are required. (3-19-07)
226. NURSING FACILITY: PROCEDURAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
01. Nursing Facility Responsibility. Each nursing facility administrator, or his authorized
representative must report the following information to the appropriate RMS within three (3) working days of the
date the facility has knowledge of the following. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 227 Page 41
a. Any readmission or discharge of a participant, and any temporary absence of a participant due to
hospitalization or therapeutic home visit. (3-19-07)
b. Any changes in the amount of a participant's income. (3-19-07)
c. When a participant's account has exceed the following amount; (3-19-07)
i. For a single individual, one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800);or (3-19-07)
ii. For a married couple, two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800). (3-19-07)
02. Other Financial Information for Participant. Other information about a participant's finances
which may potentially affect eligibility for medical assistance must be reported if the nursing facility has any
knowledge of the participant’s financial information. (3-19-07)
227. PREADMISSION SCREENING AND ADDITIONAL RESIDENT REVIEW PROGRAM
(PASARR).
All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by,
the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review program, (PASARR) as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483,
Subpart C. (3-19-07)
01. Background and Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to comply with and implement the
PASARR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The purpose of those requirements is to prevent the
placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or intellectual disabilities (ID) in a nursing facility unless their
medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of care provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplished
by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident review (ARR). Individuals, for whom it appears that a
diagnosis of MI or ID is likely, are identified for further screening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR
is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determined whether, because of the individual's physical and
mental condition, he requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility. If the individual with MI or ID is
determined to require a nursing facility level of care, it must also be determined whether the individual requires
specialized services. PASARR applies to all individuals entering or residing in a nursing facility, regardless of
payment source. (3-19-07)
02. Policy. It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in providing specialized services in the
nursing facility setting makes it generally inappropriate to place individuals needing specialized services in an
nursing facility. This policy is supported by the background and development of the federal PASARR requirements,
including the narrow definition of mental illness adopted by federal law. While recognizing that there are exceptions,
it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for nursing facility placement will not require services in excess of
those required to be provided by nursing facilities by 42 CFR 483.45. (3-19-07)
03. Inter-Agency Agreement. The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the
state mental health and intellectual disabilities authorities as required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will,
among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be
used in making determinations. (3-19-07)
a. The “State Mental Health Authority” (SMHA) in the Division of Family and Community Services
of the Department, or its successor entity. (3-19-07)
b. The “State Intellectual Disabilities or Developmental Disabilities Authority” (SDDA) in the
Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (3-19-07)
04. Coordination for PASARR. The PASARR process is a coordinated effort between the state
Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and the nursing facility. PASARR activities will be
coordinated through the Regional Medicaid Services (RMS). RMS is responsible for record retention and tracking
functions. However, the nursing facility is responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination
with the RMS, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, and their designees. Guidelines and procedures on
how to comply with these requirements can be found in the “Statewide PASARR Procedures,” a reference guide.
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 228 Page 42
 (3-19-07)
a. All required Level I screens and reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMS prior to
admission to the facility. (3-19-07)
b. When a nursing facility identifies an individual with MI or ID through a Level I screen, or
otherwise, the nursing facility is responsible for contacting the SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), and assuring that a
Level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility, or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order
to continue residing in the facility. (3-19-07)
c. Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified with MI or ID must be reviewed and
a new determination made promptly after a significant change in his physical or mental condition. The facility must
notify the RMS of any such change within two (2) working days of its occurrence. For the purpose of this section,
significant change for the participant's mental condition means a change which may require the provision of
specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that
renders the participant incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program interventions. (3-19-07)
228. NURSING FACILITY: COORDINATION OF NURSING FACILITY ELIGIBILITY AND THE
NEED FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES.
Determinations as to the need for nursing facility care and determinations as to the need for specialized services
should not be made independently. Such determinations must often be made on an individual basis, taking into
account the condition of the resident and the capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the
care needed. When an individual identified with MI and ID is admitted to a nursing facility, the nursing facility is
responsible for meeting that individual's needs, except for the provision of specialized services. (3-19-07)
01. Level of Care. (3-19-07)
a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules.
 (3-19-07)
b. Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determinations of level of care are not
always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for
categorical determinations. When nursing facility level of care is determined appropriate categorically, the individual
may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determination for specialized services. However,
conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respite admissions, which cannot exceed thirty (30)
consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. (3-19-07)
02. Specialized Services. Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1),
and for intellectual disabilities as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(2), are those services provided by the state which due
to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs which are not included in the specialized
rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be
documented and included in both the resident assessment instrument and the plan of care. (3-19-07)
a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules.
 (3-19-07)
b. Categorical determinations that specialized services are not needed may be made in those situations
permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. (3-19-07)
03. Penalty for Non-Compliance. No payment will be made for any services rendered by a nursing
facility prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if required, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASARR
requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a nursing facility to other penalties as
part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. (3-19-07)
04. Appeals. Discharges, transfers, and preadmission PASARR determinations may be appealed to the
extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, and under Section 67-5229, Idaho Code. Appeals under this
paragraph are made in accordance with the fair hearing provisions in IDAPA 16.05.03, “Rules Governing Contested
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 229 Page 43
Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.” (3-19-07)
a. A Level I finding of MI or ID is not an appealable determination. It may be disputed as part of a
Level II determination appeal. (3-19-07)
b. In the event that the PASARR program is eliminated or made non-mandatory by an act of
Congress, the provisions of Section 227 of these rules will cease to be operative on the effective date of any such act,
without further action. (3-19-07)
229. NURSING FACILITY: PREPAYMENT SCREEN AND DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT
TO MEDICAID PAYMENT FOR NURSING FACILITY CARE AND SERVICES.
The level of care for Title XIX and Title XXI payment purposes is determined by the Department. Necessity for
payment is determined in accordance with 42 CFR 483 Subpart C and Section 1919(e) (7) of the Social Security Act.
In the event a required Level II screen was not accomplished prior to admission, entitlement for Medicaid payment as
established by the RMS will not be earlier than the date the Level II screen is completed, indicating that nursing
facility placement is appropriate. (4-2-08)
01. Information Required for Medical Evaluation Determination. A current Minimum Data Set
(MDS) assessment will be provided to the Department. Additional supporting information may be requested.
 (3-19-07)
02. Information Required for Level I and II Screen Determination. An accurate Level I screen and
when required, a Level II screen. (3-19-07)
230. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES.
01. Provider Application and Certification. A facility must apply to participate as a nursing facility.
 (3-19-07)
02. Licensure and Certification. (3-19-07)
a. Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing and Certification Agency determines
the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to medical
assistance participants. (3-19-07)
b. If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing facility, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification
and program participation is required before the facility can be certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and
Certification Agency must determine the facility's compliance with Medicare requirements and recommend
certification to the Medicare Agency. (3-19-07)
c. If the Licensing and Certification Agency determines that a facility meets Title XIX certification
standards for nursing facility care. The Department must certify to the appropriate branch of government that the
facility meets the standards for nursing facility level of care. (3-19-07)
d. Upon receipt of the certification from the Licensing and Certification Agency, the Department may
enter into a provider agreement with the long-term care facility. (3-19-07)
e. After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the
Department, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the
Department (3-19-07)
232. -- 234. (RESERVED)
235. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT.
01. Payment Methodology. Nursing facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with the payment
methodologies as described in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 236 Page 44
02. Date of Discharge. Payment by the Department for the cost of long term care is to exclude the date
of the participant's discharge. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of
the time of occurrence. If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be
deemed to exist. (3-21-12)
236. NURSING FACILITY: REASONABLE COST PRINCIPLES.
To be allowable, costs must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that
providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to participants
will result. (3-19-07)
01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles. (3-19-07)
a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance with this chapter of rules found in
Sections 236 through 295 of these rules, and Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as
modified by the exceptions contained herein, is used to identify cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost
Report. (3-19-07)
i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services, including
normal standby costs. (3-19-07)
ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the
program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not
be paid by the program. (3-19-07)
b. Costs may vary from one institution to another because of a variety of factors. It is the intent of the
program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs
exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Idaho Code, or are
unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07)
c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid to the extent they are reasonable is the
expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and that its actual operating costs do not exceed what a
prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or service. (3-19-07)
d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers incur, in the absence of clear evidence
that the higher costs were unavoidable, the excess costs are not reimbursable. (3-19-07)
02. Costs Related to Patient Care. These include all necessary and proper costs in developing and
maintaining the operation of patient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs
which are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity. They include costs such as
depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance costs, administrative costs, costs of employee pension
plans, normal standby costs, and others. Example: Depreciation is a method of systematically recognizing the
declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the asset is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and
necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed based on property costs according to other provisions of
this chapter. Property related expenses are likewise allowable. (3-19-07)
03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care. Costs not related to patient care are costs which are not
appropriate or necessary and proper in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and
activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursable costs. Example: Fines are imposed for late
remittance of federal withholding taxes. Such fines are not related to patient care, are not necessary, and are not
reflective of prudent cost conscious management. Therefore, such fines and penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07)
04. Form and Substance. Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financial transactions
will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the transaction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply
with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are contracts which are executed in the form of a lease.
The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type
lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the property. If a lease contract is found to be in
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 237 Page 45
substance a purchase, the related payments are not allowable as lease or rental expense. (3-19-07)
237. NURSING FACILITY: NOTICE OF PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT.
Following receipt of the finalized Medicare Cost Report and the timely receipt of any other information requested by
the Department to fairly cost settle with the provider, a certified letter with the return receipt requested will be sent to
the provider which sets forth the amounts of underpayment or overpayment made to the provider. (3-19-07)
01. Notice. The notice of the results of the final retroactive adjustment will be sent even though the
provider intends to request a hearing on the determination, or has appealed the Medicare Intermediary's determination
of cost settlement. Where the determination shows that the provider is indebted to the Medicaid program because
total interim and other payments exceed cost limits, the state will take the necessary action to recover overpayment,
including the suspension of interim payments sixty (60) days after the provider's receipt of the notice. (3-19-07)
02. Recovery or Suspension. Such action of recovery or suspension will continue even after a request
for an informal conference or hearing is filed with the state. If the hearing results in a revised determination,
appropriate adjustments will be made to the settlement amount. (3-19-07)
03. Timing of Notice. The Department will make every effort to issue a notice of program
reimbursement within twelve (12) months of receipt of the Cost Report from the Medicare Intermediary. (3-19-07)
04. Reopening of Completed Settlements. A Medicaid completed cost settlement may be reopened
by the provider or the state within a three-year (3) period from the date of the letter of notice of program
reimbursement. The issues must have been raised, appealed and resolved through the reopening of the Cost Report by
the Medicare Intermediary. Issues previously addressed and resolved by the Department's appeal process are not
cause for reopening of the finalized cost settlement. (3-19-07)
238. NURSING FACILITY: INTEREST CHARGES ON OVERPAYMENTS AND UNDERPAYMENTS.
The Title XIX and Title XXI programs will charge interest on overpayments, and pay interest on underpayments.
 (3-19-07)
01. Interest After Sixty Days of Notice. If full repayment from the indebted party is not received
within sixty (60) days after the provider has received notice of program reimbursement, interest will accrue from the
date of receipt of the notice of program reimbursement, and will be charged on the unpaid settlement balance for each
thirty- day (30) period that payment is delayed. Periods of less than thirty (30) days will be treated as a full thirty-day
(30) period, and the thirty-day (30) interest charge will be applied to any unpaid balance. Each payment will be
applied first to accrued interest, then to the principal. Interest accrued on overpayments and interest on funds
borrowed by a provider to repay overpayments are not an allowable interest expense. (3-19-07)
02. Waiver of Interest Charges. When the Department determines an overpayment exists, it may
waive interest charges if it determines that the administrative costs of collecting them exceed the charges. (3-19-07)
03. Rate of Interest. The interest rate on overpayments and underpayments will be the statutory rate as
set forth in Section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, compounded monthly. (3-19-07)
04. Retroactive Adjustment. The balance and interest will be retroactively adjusted to equal the
amounts that would have been due based on any changes which occur as a result of the final determination in the
administrative appeal and judicial appeal process. Interest penalties will only be applied to unpaid amounts and will
be subordinated to final interest determinations made in the judicial review process. (3-19-07)
239. NURSING FACILITY: RECOVERY METHODS FOR OVERPAYMENTS.
One (1) of the following methods will be used for recovery of overpayments: (3-19-07)
01. Lump Sum Voluntary Repayment. Upon receipt of the notice of program reimbursement, the
provider voluntarily refunds, in a lump sum, the entire overpayment to the Department. (3-19-07)
02. Periodic Voluntary Repayment. The provider must request in writing that recovery of the
overpayment be made over a period of twelve (12) months or less. The provider must adequately document the
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 240 Page 46
request by demonstrating that the financial integrity of the provider would be irreparably compromised if repayments
occurred over a shorter period of time than requested. (3-19-07)
03. Department Initiated Recovery. The Department will recover the entire unpaid balance of the
overpayment of any settlement amount in which the provider does not respond to the notice of program
reimbursement within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice. (3-19-07)

IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 252 Page 51
effect before July 1, 1999. (3-19-07)
251. (RESERVED)

255. NURSING FACILITY: RATE SETTING.
The objectives of the rate setting mechanism for nursing facilities are: (3-19-07)
01. Payments. To make payments to nursing facilities through a prospective cost-based system which
includes facility-specific case mix adjustments. (3-19-07)
02. Rate Adjustment. To set rates based on each facility's case mix index on a quarterly basis and
establishing rates that reflect the case mix of that facility's Medicaid residents as of a certain date during the
preceding quarter. (3-19-07)
256. NURSING FACILITY: PRINCIPLE FOR RATE SETTING.
Reimbursement rates will be set based on projected cost data from cost reports and audit reports. Reimbursement is to
be set for freestanding and hospital-based facilities. In general, the methodology will be a cost-based prospective
reimbursement system with an acuity adjustment for direct care costs. (3-19-07)
257. NURSING FACILITY: DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATE.
Nursing facility rates are prospective, with new rates effective July 1st of each year, and are recalculated annually
with quarterly adjustments for case mix. The rate for a nursing facility is the sum of the cost components described in
Subsection 257.04 through 257.08 of this rule. In no case will the rate be set higher than the charge for like services to
private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment is made as computed by the lower of costs or
customary charges. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, rates will be calculated using audited
cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 with no allowance for inflation to the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June
30, 2012. For the rate years beginning July 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, rates will be calculated using audited cost
reports for periods ended in the preceding calendar year with no allowance for inflation to the prospective rate period.
 (4-4-13)
01. Applicable Case Mix Index (CMI). The Medicaid CMI used in establishing each facility's rate is
calculated based on the most recent assessment for each Medicaid resident in the nursing facility on the first day of
the month of the preceding quarter (for example, assessments as of April 1are used to establish the CMI needed to
establish rates for the quarter beginning July 1st). Facility-wide CMI is calculated based on the most recent
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 258 Page 52
assessment for all residents in the nursing facility. The CMI is recalculated quarterly and each nursing facility's rate is
adjusted accordingly. A facility-wide CMI is also established each year by averaging four (4) calendar quarter CMIs
for the cost reporting period from historical data to represent each fiscal quarter in the cost reporting period (for
example, an October 1 CMI would represent the fiscal quarter ended September 30th). (3-19-07)
02. Applicable Cost Data. The cost data used in establishing the cost components of the rate
calculation are from the audited or unaudited cost report which ended during the previous calendar year (for example,
cost reports ending during the period from January 1, 1998 - December 31, 1998 are used in setting rates effective
July 1, 1999). The draft audit of a cost report submitted by a facility will be issued by the Department no later than
five (5) months after the date all information required for completion of the audit is filed with the Department.
 (3-19-07)
03. Interim Rates. Nursing facilities with unaudited cost reports are given an interim rate established
by the Department until a rate is calculated based on an audited cost report. When audited data are available, a
retroactive adjustment to the payment rate is made through the calculation of the finalized rate. (3-19-07)
04. Direct Care Cost Component. The direct care cost component of a nursing facility's rate is
determined as follows: (3-19-07)
a. The direct care per diem cost limit applicable to the rate period for a nursing facility type (freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facility, rural hospital-based nursing facility, free-standing and urban
hospital-based behavioral care unit, or rural hospital-based behavioral care unit) is identified. The identified direct
care cost limit is divided by the statewide average CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the
nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period to derive the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit.
 (4-4-13)
b. The adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is compared to the nursing facility's inflated direct care
per diem costs. The lower of the two (2) amounts is then case mix adjusted. (3-19-07)
i. If the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is lower, the adjusted limit is divided by the nursing
facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent
quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07)
ii. If the inflated direct care per diem costs are lower, these costs, minus raw food and Medicaid
related ancillary costs, are divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, then
multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period. Raw food and Medicaid
related ancillary costs are then added back to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07)
05. Indirect Care Cost Component. The indirect care cost component of a facility's rate is the lesser
of the facility's inflated indirect care per diem costs, or the indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider -- freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care unit nursing facility providers, or rural
hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care unit nursing facility providers. (4-4-13)
06. Costs Exempt From Limitation. Costs exempt from cost limits are property taxes, property
insurance, utilities and costs related to new legal mandates as defined in Section 264 of these rules. (3-19-07)
07. Property Reimbursement. The property reimbursement component is calculated in accordance
with Section 275 and Subsection 240.19 of these rules. (3-19-07)
08. Revenue Offset. Revenues from products or services provided to nonpatients will be offset from
the corresponding rate component(s) as described in Section 257 of this rule. (4-4-13)
258. NURSING FACILITY: COST LIMITS BASED ON COST REPORT.
Each July 1st cost limitations will be established for nursing facilities based on the most recent audited cost report
with an end date of June 30th of the previous year or before. Calculated limitations will be effective for a one (1) year
period, from July 1 through June 30th of each year, which is the rate year. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through
June 30, 2012, the direct and indirect cost limits were calculated using the most recent audited cost reports adjusted to
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 259 Page 53
the midpoint of the cost reporting year’s end in calendar year 2010, to allow for no inflation to the rate year. For rate
years beginning July 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the direct and indirect cost limits will be calculated using the
most recent audited cost reports adjusted to the midpoint of each provider's cost reporting year that is used to set the
July 1 rate, to allow for no inflation to the rate year. (4-4-13)
01. Percentage Above Bed-Weighted Median. (4-4-13)
a. Prior to establishing the first “shadow rates” at July 1, 1999, the estimated Medicaid payments
under the previous retrospective system for the year period from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will be
calculated. This amount will then be used to model the estimated payments under the case mix system set forth in
Sections 255 through 257 of these rules. The percentages above the bed-weighted median, for direct and indirect
costs, will be established at a level that approximates the same amount of Medicaid expenditures as would have been
produced by the retrospective system. The percentages will also be established to approximate the same distribution
of total Medicaid dollars between the hospital-based and freestanding nursing facilities as existed under the
retrospective system. (4-4-13)
b. Once the percentage is established, it will be used to calculate the limit by multiplying the bedweighted median per diem direct cost times the calculated percentage for that class of provider. There will be a direct
and indirect percentage that is applied to freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities, and a higher direct
and indirect percentage that is applied to rural hospital-based nursing facilities. (4-4-13)
c. Beginning with rates effective October 1, 2012, additional direct care cost limit categories will be
added for free-standing and urban hospital-based behavioral care units and rural hospital-based behavioral care units.
Percentages previously established for other provider class types not considered a behavioral care unit will remain
unchanged. Once established, these percentages will remain in effect for future rate setting periods. (4-4-13)
02. Direct Cost Limits. The direct cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data
forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for
which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be normalized and arrayed from high to low,
with all nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (4-4-13)
03. Indirect Cost Limits. The indirect cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost
data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for
which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be arrayed, with all nursing facilities included
in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (4-4-13)
04. Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits. Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits
will be determined by the limitations calculated in the most recent base year, indexed forward each year from the
midpoint of the base year to the midpoint of the rate year by the inflation factor plus one percent (1%) per annum. The
calculated direct and indirect cost limits will not be allowed to decrease below the limitations effective in the base
year. The maximum rate of growth on the cost limits, and the minimum cost limitation, will be examined by the
oversight committee periodically to determine which factors to use in the calculation of the limitations effective in the
new base year and forward. (3-29-10)
05. Costs Exempt From Limitations. Costs exempt from limitations include property taxes, property
insurance, and utilities. These costs will be reimbursed on a per diem basis and will not be included in the calculation
of the direct or indirect care component. However, property taxes and property insurance will be subject to minimum
occupancy levels as defined in Section 278 of these rules. (3-19-07)
259. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW BEDS.
Facilities that add beds after July 1, 1999, will have their reimbursement rate subjected to an additional limitation for
the next three (3) years. This limitation will apply beginning with the first rate setting period which utilizes a cost
report that includes the date when the beds were added. (3-19-07)
01. Limitation of Facilities Rate. The facility's rate will be limited to the bed-weighted average of the
following two (2) rates: (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 260 Page 54
a. The facility's current prospective rate calculated in accordance with Section 257 of these rules; and
 (3-19-07)
b. The current median rate for nursing facilities of that type, free-standing, rural hospital-based, or
urban hospital-based, established each July 1st. (3-19-07)
02. Calculation of the Bed-Weighted Average. The current calculated facility rate is multiplied by the
number of beds in existence prior to the addition. The median rate is multiplied by the number of added beds,
weighted for the number of days in the cost reporting period for which they were in service. These two (2) amounts
are added together and divided by the total number of beds, with the new beds being weighted if they were only in
service for a portion of the year. The resulting per diem amount represents an overall limitation on the facility's
reimbursement rate. Providers with calculated rates that do not exceed the limitation receive their calculated rate.
 (3-19-07)
03. Exception to New Bed Rate. The following situations will not be treated as new beds for
reimbursement purposes: (3-19-07)
a. Any beds converted from nursing facility beds to assisted living beds, can be converted back to
nursing facility beds within three (3) years and not be classified as new nursing facility beds. When a nursing facility
bed has been converted to an assisted living bed for three (3) or more concurrent years and the bed is converted back
to a nursing facility bed, it must be treated as a new nursing facility bed. (3-19-07)
b. Beds added as a result of expansion plans, which the Department was aware of prior to July 1,
1999, will not be treated as new beds. The facility must have already expended significant resources on the purchase
of land, site planning, site utility planning, and development. The existence of adequate land or space at the nursing
facility does not by itself constitute a significant expenditure of resources for the purposes of expansion. A written
request with adequate supporting documentation for an exception under this provision must have been received by
the Department no later than December 31, 1999. In no case will beds added after July 1, 2003, qualify for this
exception to the new bed criteria. (3-19-07)
c. Beds which are decertified as a requirement of survey and certification due to deficiencies at the
facility can be re-certified as existing beds with the approval of the Department. (3-19-07)
d. When a facility can demonstrate to the Department that adding beds is necessary to meet the needs
of an under served area, these beds will not be treated as new beds. For an existing facility the new beds are
reimbursed at the same reimbursement rate for that facility's existing beds. For a new facility, the reimbursement rate
is negotiated with the Department. (3-19-07)
260. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW FACILITIES.
Facilities constructed subsequent to July 1, 1999, will be reimbursed at the median rate for skilled care facilities of
that type (freestanding or hospital-based) for the first three (3) full years of operation. During the period of limitation,
the facility's rate will be modified each July 1st to reflect the current median rate for skilled care facilities of that type.
After the first three (3) full years, the facility will have its rate established at the next July 1st with the existing
facilities in accordance with Section 257 of this rule. (3-19-07)
261. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP.
New providers resulting from a change in ownership of an existing facility will receive the previous owner's rate until
such time as the new owner has a cost report which qualifies for the rate setting criteria established under these rules.
If the Department determines that such a facility is operationally or financially unstable, the Department may
negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for the facility. (5-8-09)
262. NURSING FACILITY: OUT-OF-STATE NURSING HOMES.
The Idaho Medicaid Program will reimburse for out-of-state nursing home placements when services are not
available in Idaho to meet the participant's medical need, or in a temporary situation for a limited period of time
required to safely transport the participant to an Idaho facility. Reimbursement for out-of-state nursing homes will be
at the per diem rate set by the Medicaid Program in the state where the nursing home is located. Special rates will be
allowed according to Section 270 of these rules. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 263 Page 55
263. NURSING FACILITY: DISTRESSED FACILITY.
01. Determination. If the Department determines that a facility is located in an under-served area, or
addresses an under-served need, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in
effect for that facility. (5-8-09)
02. Discretionary Factors. The fact that a facility may be located in an under-served area or meets an
under-served need does not guarantee increased reimbursement. In exercising its discretion to apply a higher rate, the
Department will consider the factors as described in Subsections 263.02.a. through 263.02.e. of this rule. (5-8-09)
a. Prudent Spending Patterns. The facility has exercised prudent spending and cost allocation
practices, as evidenced by a thorough and comprehensive review of the facility’s accounts by the Department.
 (5-8-09)
b. Reasonable Attempts to Remedy Problems. The facility must persuade the Department that it has
conscientiously and diligently attempted to cover its costs of care, hire qualified staff and otherwise operate
effectively and efficiently, but for causes beyond the facility’s reasonable control, it has not been able to do so.
 (5-8-09)
c. Facility Already Receives Special Rates. When a facility already receives special rates for certain
difficulty-of-care patients from the Department, the same costs of care that were used to determine special rates will
not be applied toward a determination of distressed facility status, because the special rate meets that need.
 (5-8-09)
d. Direct and Indirect Costs of Care Apportioned to Patient Care. The Department reimburses the
costs of patient care, and does not pay for indirect costs not associated with patient care. The determination of
distressed status will focus on whether the facility’s distress stems from patient care costs, or whether the distress
arises from expenses unrelated to patient care costs. (5-8-09)
e. Existing Cost Limits.Under no circumstances may a facility’s reimbursement exceed the lower of
its actual costs or customary charge to private-pay patients, as required by federal law, subject to the exceptions in
federal law. The Department’s cost caps can be exceeded through the distressed facility process, but to an amount no
greater than the federal upper payment limit. (5-8-09)
03. Annual Review. Distressed facility payments are assumed to be short-term in nature. Each
distressed payment must be re-requested and re-justified for each subsequent fiscal year that the facility desires the
distressed facility rate. (5-8-09)
04. Prospective Application. Distressed facility status will be applied only to facilities that are
currently distressed or entering a period of distress. Distressed facility status will not be applied to retroactive rate
years. (5-8-09)
05. Facility-by-Facility Basis. Each facility must independently establish distress on its own merits,
whether or not other facilities with a common owner may also be experiencing distress. (5-8-09)
264. NURSING FACILITY: INTERIM ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES AS A RESULT OF NEW
MANDATES.
Certain costs may be excluded from the cost limit calculations, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the
discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rates as provided in this Section to assure
equitable reimbursement: (3-19-07)
01. Changes of More Than Fifty Cents Per Patient Day in Costs. Changes of more than fifty cents
($.50) per patient day in costs otherwise subject to the cost limitations incurred by a facility as a result of changes in
state or federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cost report until such time as they can be properly
reflected in the cost limits. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 265 Page 56
a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that
these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. These costs will be reported separately
and will not be reimbursed through the rate setting process until the costs are fully represented in the cost data used to
establish the cost limitations and rates. (3-19-07)
b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule changes, the costs
from each event are to be reported separately. (3-19-07)
c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a
supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department states otherwise. (3-19-07)
02. Interim Rate Adjustments. For interim rate purposes, the provider may be granted an increase in
its prospective rate to cover such cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may be required with
justification for the increased costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be determined at audit and may
be retrospectively settled. (3-19-07)
03. Future Treatment of Costs. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost
reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were first required, the Department
will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases in the calculation of costs
subject to the cost center limits. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cost limits until these
costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated into the data base used to project the cost limits. When cost
increases which have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cost limits,
the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount included in the index is
identified. When the cost limits are set to include previously excluded amounts, any adjustments made to the indices
related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. (3-19-07)
265. NURSING FACILITY: MDS REVIEWS.
The following Minimum Data Set (MDS) reviews will be conducted: (3-19-07)
01. Facility Review. Subsequent to the picture date, each facility will be sent a copy of its resident
roster (a listing of residents, their RUG classification, case mix index, and identification as Medicaid or other). It will
be the facility's responsibility at that time to review the roster for accuracy. If the roster is accurate, the facility will
sign and return the roster for rate setting. If any errors are detected, those errors will be communicated to the
Department in writing along with any supporting documentation. If the signed resident roster is not returned and no
errors are communicated to the Department, the original resident roster will be used for rate setting. Once the resident
roster has been used for rate setting, it will be considered final unless modified by subsequent Departmental review.
 (3-19-07)
02. Departmental Review. If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an
incorrect case mix index, the provider's rate will be retroactively adjusted, for all quarters containing the incorrect
assessment, and an amount due to or from the Department will be calculated. This does not include residents who
received the default classification due to incomplete or inconsistent MDS data. (3-19-07)
266. NURSING FACILITY: BEHAVIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU) AND RATE STRUCTURE.
Effective October 1, 2012, the additional direct care costs associated with BCU residents will remain in direct care
costs subject to the direct care cost limitation. Those qualifying BCU nursing facility providers may have a direct care
cost limitation higher than non-BCU nursing facility providers. BCU nursing facility providers will not receive an
increased indirect care cost limitation. (4-4-13)
01. Determination. The BCU must have a qualifying program and have been providing care in the
BCU to behavior residents as of July 1, 2011. Nursing facility providers that meet the BCU criteria will have BCU
direct care costs included in direct care costs subject to the cost limit. The direct care cost limitation may be higher
than a non-BCU nursing facility. (4-4-13)
02. BCU Routine Customary Charge. If the cost to operate a BCU is included in a nursing facility's
rate calculation, the nursing facility must report its usual and customary charge for semi-private rooms in both the
BCU and general nursing facility. A weighted average routine customary charge is computed to represent the
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 266 Page 57
composite of all Medicaid nursing facility residents in the nursing facility based on the type of rooms they occupy,
including the BCU. (4-4-13)
03. Prospective Rate Setting. Beginning October 1, 2012, the direct care cost limit calculation for any
special rate revenue offsets in the prior year related to one-to-one (1:1) staffing ratios, BCU, or increased staffing,
will be reversed before calculating the cost limit. This revenue offset reversal excludes revenues related to special rate
add-ons for ventilator-dependent or tracheostomy services. Rates will be calculated using the cost report ended in the
calendar year prior to each July 1 rate setting period with the BCU's direct care costs included in direct care costs
subject to the higher BCU cost limit. (4-4-13)
04. Rates Effective October 1, 2012. For rates effective October 1, 2012, a nursing facility designated
as a BCU during each nursing facility provider's cost report ended in calendar year 2011 must be identified. (4-4-13)
a. Days approved for a BCU during the 2011 cost report year must be identified. (4-4-13)
b. To qualify as a BCU, Medicaid BCU days identified in Subsection 266.04.a. of this rule, are
divided by total days in the nursing facility and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimum of fifteen percent
(15%). (4-4-13)
05. Annual Rates Beginning July 1, 2013. For annual rates beginning July 1, 2013, once a rate has
been set as provided in Subsection 266.03 of this rule, the following process will be used to determine BCU
eligibility. A nursing facility must apply for BCU eligibility on an annual basis. Eligibility is determined by: (4-4-
13)
a. BCU days, regardless of payer source, are divided by the total occupied days in the nursing facility
and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimum of twenty percent (20%). (4-4-13)
b. The BCU nursing facility provider must provide a list of all residents they believe were qualified
for BCU status for the previous year; (4-4-13)
i. The Department will select a sample of Idaho Medicaid participants from the submitted list. The
nursing facility provider must send the MDS for each selected sample participant, along with related census
information, and other requested information to the Department. (4-4-13)
ii. The Department will review this information to determine that the participants meet the
requirements of Subsection 266.06 of this rule and calculate the percentage of BCU days to the total occupied days in
the facility to determine whether the facility meets the BCU eligibility requirement in Subsection 266.05.a. of this
rule. (4-4-13)
06. Participant Characteristics. All participants in a BCU must meet the criteria for nursing facility
level of care, and have the following characteristics as provided in the participants’ MDS assessment: (4-4-13)
a. Medically based behavior disorder which causes a significantly diminished capacity for judgment,
retention of information, or decision making skills, or medically based mental health disorder of diagnosis and has a
high level resource use; and (4-4-13)
b. Must have a history or demonstrate need for additional resources to provide for disruptive
behaviors requiring enhanced resource use from nursing facility staff, evidenced by one (1) or more of the following:
 (4-4-13)
i. Wandering behaviors; (4-4-13)
ii. Verbally abusive behaviors; (4-4-13)
iii. Physically abusive behaviors; (4-4-13)
iv. Socially inappropriate or disruptive behaviors, such as verbal or vocal symptoms like disruptive
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 266 Page 58
sounds, noises, screaming, physical symptoms like self-abusive acts, public sexual behavior or disrobing in public,
smearing or throwing food or bodily wastes, hoarding, rummaging through belongings of other residents; (4-4-13)
v. Behaviors that resist care; or (4-4-13)
vi. Does not meet unit discharge criteria outlined in Subsection 266.13 of this rule. (4-4-13)
c. A behavior baseline profile must be established for each participant; (4-4-13)
d. A behavior intervention program must be in place for each participant, designed to reduce or
control the inappropriate behaviors to enhance the participant's quality of life, functional and cognitive status or
safety. (4-4-13)
07. BCU Annual Renewal. The facility must request continuation in the BCU program annually. The
request must include the following: (4-4-13)
a. A description of the facility's program that includes the required components in Subsections 266.05
and 266.06 of this rule; and (4-4-13)
b. A profile of the types of behavior of participants served and any restrictions the facility has
adopted. (4-4-13)
08. Administrative and Staffing Requirements. (4-4-13)
a. Staffing must be at a level necessary for the facility to be able to provide direct supervision of
participants as needed. (4-4-13)
b. Psychiatrist or physician extender must be available to consult as needed for initial and on-going
assessments and for twenty-four hours a day/seven days a week (24/7) emergency services. Consultants must make at
least quarterly site visits and be available to participate in Behavior Management Team meetings as needed. (4-4-13)
c. Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), or Licensed
Social Worker (LSW) with behavioral experience must be available to consult as needed, make periodic site visits
and to participate in the assessment, behavioral intervention planning, behavioral intervention implementation and
Behavior Management Team meetings as needed. (4-4-13)
09. Behavior Management Team Meetings. Weekly behavior management team meetings must be
conducted that include but are not limited to psychiatrist, physician, facility social services staff, behavior program
director, director of nursing services, dietary manager, recreational services or activity director, and selected primary
care staff. Physicians, psychiatrists, social services consultants and other off-site specialists are included as needed,
and may participate in person or by telephone. (4-4-13)
10. Staff Training. Behavioral training classes for staff that are tailored to the needs of the positions
involved, and includes appropriate information on: (4-4-13)
a. Assessment and prevention; (4-4-13)
b. Medication and side effects; (4-4-13)
c. Effects of disease process on mood state; (4-4-13)
d. Safety techniques; (4-4-13)
e. Deflecting aggression or target behaviors; (4-4-13)
f. Comprehensive environmental intervention; (4-4-13)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 266 Page 59
g. Stress management; and (4-4-13)
h. Documentation and charting. (4-4-13)
11. Yearly Training. Yearly training for behavioral interventions and safety techniques is required for
staff. (4-4-13)
12. Care Planning, Behavioral Management, and Programming. Individualized care plans, based
on assessments of cognitive and functional abilities, along with behavior analysis to create a strategy for prevention
and intervention that are documented for each participant and include the following: (4-4-13)
a. Thirty (30) day assessments of progress made by each participant, must be completed, documented,
and reviewed by the facility's behavioral management team. (4-4-13)
b. Comprehensive behavior monitoring techniques that track and trend the intensity and daily
occurrence of behaviors, successful interventions, and behavior modification techniques used must be documented
for each participant. (4-4-13)
c. Attempts to involve family and responsible parties with the participant through visits, training,
outings, or appropriate communications, must be documented. (4-4-13)
d. Recreational and activity programming must be targeted to specific needs of each individual
participant and the behaviors each participant exhibits must be documented. (4-4-13)
e. Integration for appropriate social interactions must be used when appropriate for each individual
participant. (4-4-13)
f. Community for transition must be used when appropriate for each individual participant. (4-4-13)
g. Attempts to meet discharge criteria must be documented for each individual participant when
progress shows a decline in the need for special care programming. (4-4-13)
13. Discharge Criteria. The BCU must maintain and document discharge criteria as follows: (4-4-13)
a. Document improvement in ability to function that would enable transfer to less-restrictive
environment. (4-4-13)
b. Document lack of benefit from specialized programs offered in BCU. (4-4-13)
c. Document consistent refusals by participant or responsible party to allow interventions that are
determined to be helpful, (4-4-13)
d. Document acute danger to self or others that cannot be managed by staffing in the BCU. (4-4-13)
e. Document acute physical illness or complications requiring a higher level of medical care than
available in the facility. (4-4-13)
f. A nursing facility provider that is approved for one-hundred percent (100%) behavioral participants
will be exempt for the discharge criteria provided in Subsections 266.13.a. through 266.13.e. of this rule. (4-4-13)
14. Termination of BCU Status. If a provider opts to leave the BCU program, the Department must be
notified so the direct care cap can be adjusted to that of a non-BCU provider, beginning with the next rate year.
 (4-4-13)
15. Refusal of Admissions. These rules do not preclude a nursing facility from refusing to admit a
participant whose needs cannot be met by the nursing facility. (4-4-13)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 267 Page 60
267. NURSING FACILITY: NEW BEHAVIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU).
01. Criteria to Qualify as a New BCU. A nursing facility provider must meet the following criteria to
qualify as a new BCU nursing facility provider: (4-4-13)
a. BCU days from the cost report period, regardless of payer source, are divided by the total occupied
days in the nursing facility, and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimum of twenty percent (20%). (4-4-13)
b. A qualifying cost report must demonstrate that the nursing facility provider has a qualifying
program in place with residents. (4-4-13)
02. First Cost Reporting Year. No BCU eligibility, or increased direct care cost limit will be allowed
in the first cost reporting year the BCU program is added. (4-4-13)
03. Qualifying Report in Tandem with BCU Eligibility. Once a qualifying cost report is submitted
for the BCU program, and the nursing facility provider qualifies in tandem with the BCU eligibility criteria, the cost
report will be used to set a prospective rate effective the following July 1 rate period with the increased direct care
cost limit. (4-4-13)
268. NURSING FACILITY: EXISTING PROVIDER ELECTS TO ADD BEHAVIORAL CARE UNIT
(BCU).
An existing nursing facility provider that elects to add a BCU after July 1, 2011, may be deemed eligible after
meeting the following requirements: (4-4-13)
01. Qualifying Cost Report. A qualifying cost report that demonstrates a qualifying program is in
place with residents and meets the criteria in Section 282 of these rules. (4-4-13)
02. Meet Criteria for BCU. The nursing facility provider must meet the criteria for a BCU described
in Section 266 of these rules. (4-4-13)
03. BCU Payments. No BCU payments or increased direct care cost limits will be allowed in the first
cost reporting year the program is added. Once a qualifying cost report is submitted, and the provider qualifies in
tandem with the BCU criteria, the cost report will be used to set a prospective rate, effective with the following July 1
rate period with the increased direct care cost limit. (4-4-13)
269. NURSING FACILITY: NEW OWNER OF AN EXISTING NURSING FACILITY WITH A
BEHAVIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU).
01. New Owner Elects to Continue BCU. An existing nursing facility that is considered a BCU will
continue to be a BCU, if the new owner elects to continue to provide these services. The new owner will receive a
rate calculated according to the current change of ownership rules in Section 261 of these rules. The prior owner's
cost report will be used until the new owner has a qualifying cost report. They BCU will continue to qualify for the
higher direct care cost limit the previous owner was allowed. (4-4-13)
02. New Owner Does Not Elect to Continue BCU. If the new owner does not elect to operate the
BCU, the prior owner's cost report will be used. The direct care cost limit will be adjusted down to that of the nonBCU nursing facility. (4-4-13)
270. NURSING FACILITY: SPECIAL RATES.
A special rate consists of a facility's daily reimbursement rate for a patient plus an add-on amount. Section 56-117,
Idaho Code, provides authority for the Department to pay facilities an amount in addition to the daily rate when a
patient has needs that are beyond the scope of facility services and when the cost of providing for those additional
needs is not adequately reflected in the rates calculated. This special rate add-on amount for such specialized care is
in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provisions of this chapter and is excluded from the
computation of payments or rates under other provisions in these rules. (4-4-13)
01. Determination. The Department determines to approve a special rate on a patient-by-patient basis.

No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is available from a non-Medicaid source. A special rate
request must be based on an identified condition that will continue for a period greater than thirty (30) days. (3-4-11)
02. Effective Date. Upon approval, a special rate is effective on the date the application was received.
 (3-4-11)
03. Reporting. Costs equivalent to payments for special rate add-on amounts must be removed from
the cost components subject to limits, and be reported separately by the provider. (3-19-07)
04. Limitation. A special rate cannot exceed the provider's charges to other patients for similar
services. (3-19-07)
05. Prospective Rate Treatment. Prospective treatment of special rates became effective July 1, 2000.
Subsections 270.06 and 270.07 of this rule provide clarification of how special rates are paid under the prospective
payment system. (4-4-13)
06. Determination of Payment for Qualifying Residents. Special rate add-on amounts are calculated
using one (1) of the methods described in Subsections 270.06.a. through 270.06.c. of this rule. (4-4-13)
a. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility Existing July 1, 2000. If on July 1, 2000, an
entire facility was a special care unit which included Medicaid residents, the facility's direct care cost per diem will
not be subject to the direct care cost limit. However, the direct care costs are case mix adjusted based on the ratio of
the facility's Medicaid CMI for the rate period to the facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period. (3-19-07)
b. Equipment and Non-Therapy Supplies. Equipment and non-therapy supplies not addressed in
Section 225 of these rules as determined by the Department, are reimbursed in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.09,
“Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits,” Section 755, as an add-on amount. (4-4-13)
c. Ventilator Dependent Residents and Residents Receiving Tracheostomy Care. In the case of
residents who are ventilator-dependent and who receive tracheostomy care, the special add-on amount to the facility's
rate for approved residents receiving this care, is determined by combining the following two (2) components:
 (4-4-13)
i. Calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, for additional direct care staff required in
meeting the exceptional needs of these residents. The hourly add-on rate is equal to the current WAHR CNA or
current WAHR RN wage rate plus a benefits allowance based on annual cost report data, then weighted to remove the
CNA minimum daily staffing time adjusted for the appropriate skill level of care staff; and (4-4-13)
ii. Calculation of an add-on for equipment and non-therapy supplies following the provisions in
Subsection 270.06.b. of this rule. (4-4-13)
07. Treatment of the Special Rate Cost for Future Rate Setting Periods. Special rates are
established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facility rate. When the cost report used to set a prospective
rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to “offset,” or reduce costs by an amount equal to total
incremental revenues, or add-on payments received by the provider during the cost reporting period. The amount
received is calculated by multiplying the special rate add-on amount paid for each qualifying resident by the number
of days that were paid. No related adjustment is made to the facility's CMIs. (4-4-13)
08. Special Rate for Providers that Change Ownership or Close. When a facility changes
ownership or closes, a closing cost report is not required. Special rate payments made in the closing cost reporting
period may be reviewed by the Department. (4-4-13)
271. NURSING FACILITY: OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.
The Director will appoint an oversight committee to monitor implementation of the Prospective Payment System
(PPS) for nursing facility reimbursement. The committee will be made up of at least one (1) member representing
each of the following organizations: the Department, the state associations representing free standing skilled care
facilities, and the state associations representing hospital-based skilled care facilities. The committee will continue to
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 272 Page 62
meet periodically subsequent to the implementation of the PPS. (5-8-09)
272. NURSING FACILITY: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.
Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the
following: (3-19-07)
01. In General. Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an
audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or litigation costs incurred by the provider in an action
unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfare, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs
of which the Medicaid Program will reimburse a portion according to the percentage of Medicaid patient days.
 (3-19-07)
02. Administrative Appeals. In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appeal the
findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider’s legal counsel will
be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that the provider prevails on the issues involved. The
determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit
period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing
officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07)
03. Other. All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in actions against the Department of
Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where
specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07)
273. NURSING FACILITY: PATIENT FUNDS.
The safekeeping of patient funds, under the program, is the responsibility of the provider. Accordingly, the
administration of these funds requires scrupulous care in recording all transactions for the patient. (3-19-07)
01. Use. Generally, funds are provided for personal needs of the patient to be used at the patient's
discretion. The provider agrees to manage these funds and render an accounting but may not use them in any way.
 (3-19-07)
02. Provider Liability. The provider is subject to legal and financial liabilities for committing any of
the following acts. This is only a partial listing of the acts contrary to federal regulations: (3-19-07)
a. Management fees may not be charged for managing patient trust funds. These charges constitute
double payment as management is normally performed by an employee of the provider and their salary is included in
reasonable cost reimbursement. (3-19-07)
b. Nothing is to be deducted from these funds, unless such deductions are authorized by the patient or
his agent in writing. (3-19-07)
c. Interest accruing to patient funds on deposit is the property of the patients and is part of the
personal funds of each patient. The interest from these funds is not available to the provider for any use, including
patient benefits. (3-19-07)
03. Fund Management. Proper management of such funds would include the following as minimum:
 (3-19-07)
a. Savings accounts, maintained separately from facility funds. (3-19-07)
b. An accurate system of supporting receipts and disbursements to patients. (3-19-07)
c. Written authorization for all deductions. (3-19-07)
d. Signature verification. (3-19-07)
e. Deposit of all receipts of the same day as received. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 274 Page 63
f. Minimal funds kept in the facility. (3-19-07)
g. As a minimum these funds must be kept locked at all times. (3-19-07)
h. Statement of policy regarding patient's funds and property. (3-19-07)
i. Periodic review of these policies with employees at training sessions and with all new employees
upon employment. (3-19-07)
j. System of periodic review and correction of policies and financial records of patient property and
funds. (3-19-07)
274. NURSING FACILITY: IDAHO OWNER-ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION.
Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be
limited based on the schedule in this section. (3-19-07)
01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation. The following schedule will be used in
determining the maximum amount of owner administrative compensation allowable for the calendar year ending
December 31, 2002.
 (3-19-07)
02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule. The administrative compensation schedule in this
Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in average hourly earnings in nursing and personal care
facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its successor organization or, if unavailable, another
nationally recognized forecasting firm. (3-19-07)
03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation. The maximum allowable compensation for an owner
providing administrative services is determined from the schedule in Subsection 274.01 of these rules. Allowable
compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07)
a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, all licensed beds for which the
individual provides administrative services will be counted, regardless of whether they are in the same facility.
 (3-19-07)
b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, the amounts shown on the schedule
for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limit for allowable compensation. (3-19-07)
c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to
administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate allowable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one
(51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative services may be performed by the owner and will be
allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To be allowable, hours for each type of service will be
documented. In no event will the total compensation for administrative and non-administrative duties paid to an
owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that
would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with
fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 274.01 of these rules. (3-19-07)
Licensed Bed Range Upper limit
51 - 100 86,951
101 - 150 95,641
151 - 250 129,878
251 - up 186,435
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 275 Page 64
04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner. Compensation for persons related to an owner
will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. (3-19-07)
05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider. When an owner provides
services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be distributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for
non-owners. (3-19-07)
06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensation for Hours Actually
Worked. Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary. Total compensation must be reasonable,
and not greater than the amount for which the same services could be obtained on the open market. The standard by
which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand eighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a
party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of this chapter, and will not exceed the compensation
determined from the Administrative Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the
compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Schedule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080).
 (3-19-07)
275. NURSING FACILITY: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT.
Free standing nursing facilities other than hospital based nursing facilities will be paid a property rental rate. Property
taxes and property insurance will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate includes
compensation for major movable equipment but not for minor movable equipment. The property rental rate is paid in
lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. Prior
to final audit for free-standing nursing facilities, an interim rate for property reimbursement will be set to
approximate the property rental rate as determined by Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code. (3-19-07)
01. Property Rental Rate. The property rental rate is based upon current construction costs, the age of
the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property
costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to Section
275.01 of these rules, and, beginning April 1, 1985, will be: (3-19-07)
R = “Property Base” x 40 - “Age” / 40 x “change in building costs” where: (3-19-07)
a. “R” = the property rental rate. (3-19-07)
b. “Property Base” = thirteen dollars and nineteen cents ($13.19) beginning October 1, 1996 for all
freestanding nursing facilities. (3-19-07)
c. “Change in building costs” = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. Beginning
January 1, 1997, “change in building costs” will be adjusted each calendar year to reflect the reported annual change
in the building cost index for a class D building in the western region, as published by the Marshall Swift Valuation
Service or the consumer price index for renter’s costs whichever is greater. For freestanding nursing facilities, the
index available in September of the prior year will be used. (3-19-07)
d. “Age” of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in
which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from the year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or
portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30) years, however: (3-19-07)
i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to document that the facility, or portion
thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set at thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include,
but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building permits, tax assessors’ records, receipts, invoices,
building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be determined for each building. A weighted
average using the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of
each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be
adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large
enough to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more years according to the following formula: (3-19-07)
r = A x E / S x C
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 275 Page 65
Where:
If the result of this calculation, “r” is equal to or greater than 2.0, the age of the building in years will be
reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less
than zero (0). (3-19-07)
ii. Historical nursing home construction cost per square foot for purposes of evaluating facility age.
 (3-19-07)
iii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the
cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation of a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the
change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the formula in Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. However,
such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the point where the increase in the property rental
rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate “r” for a new facility at the
time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before
the adjustment. The cost used for “C” will be adjusted according to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation
Service to reflect current construction costs for average Class D convalescent hospitals. It is the provider’s
responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation
of costs. (3-19-07)
iv. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will
reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requirements as an increase in the property rental rate if the
expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one
hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twelve (12) months of verification of expenditure,
reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new requirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility.
 (3-19-07)
v. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility be less than the greater of the rate allowable
to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immediately following the first opening of a new facility
after December 31, 1988, or the rate allowable immediately following the last, if any, age revision after December 31,
1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made
for current or successor operators, the final settlement amount of any increase in the property rental rate will first be
r = Reduction in the age of the facility in years.
A = Age of the building at the time when construction was completed.
E = Actual expenses for the construction provided that the total costs must have been
incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of the construction.
S = The number of square feet in the building at the end of construction.
C = The cost of construction for the buildings in the year when construction was
completed according to the schedule in Subsection 275.01.d.ii.
Age Year Cost Age Year Cost Age Year Cost
1 2004 82.41 2 2003 80.80 3 2002 79.06

offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the
provisions of Subsections 275.01.d.iii. and 275.01.d.iv. of these rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow
the postponement of the financial burden to providers of property rental rate decreases and to allow an equal offset of
the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate increases for a current or successor provider. (3-19-07)
vi. Effective July 1, 1991, for freestanding nursing facilities, “age of facility” will be a revised age
which is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Section or the age which most closely yields
the rate allowable to existing facilities as of June 30, 1991, under Subsection 275.01 of these rules. This revised age
will not increase over time. (3-19-07)
02. Grandfathered Rate. A “grandfathered property rental rate” for existing free-standing nursing
facilities will be determined by dividing the audited allowable annualized property costs, exclusive of taxes and
insurance, for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, by the total patient days in the period July 1, 1984, through June
30, 1985. (3-19-07)
a. Prior to audit settlement, the interim rate for property costs allowable as of January 1, 1985, will be
used to approximate the grandfathered rate. (3-19-07)
b. The grandfathered property rental rate will be adjusted to compensate the facility for the property
costs of major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling or renovation initiated prior to April 1, 1985, and
completed during calendar year 1985. (3-19-07)
c. Beginning July 1, 1989, facilities receiving grandfathered rates may have those rates adjusted for
modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1,
1986, if the cost of these modifications would be sufficient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more
according to Subsection 275.01.d.i.of these rules. The grandfathered rate will be revised after completion of
modifications and will be the greater of: (3-19-07)
i. The grandfathered rate previously allowed; or (3-19-07)
ii. The actual per diem property costs of amortization, depreciation and interest not applicable to the
modifications for the audit period in which the modifications were completed plus the per diem rate of the first year
amortization of the cost of these modifications when amortized over American Hospital Association guideline useful
life or lives. However, no change in the grandfathered rate will be allowed to change that rate by more than threefourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous grandfathered rate and the property rental rate that would be paid
for a new building at the time of the proposed rate revision. (3-19-07)
d. The facility will be reimbursed a rate which is the higher of the grandfathered property rental rate
as determined according to provisions of Subsection 275.02 of these rules or the property rental rate determined
according to Subsections 275.01, 275.03, or 275.05 of these rules. (3-19-07)
03. Leased Freestanding Nursing Facilities. Freestanding nursing facilities with leases will not be
reimbursed in the same manner specified in Subsections 275.01 and 275.02 of these rules. Provisions in this section
do not apply to reimbursement of home office costs. Home office costs will be paid based on reasonable cost
principles. (3-19-07)
a. Facilities with leases entered into on or after March 30, 1981, are to be reimbursed in the same way
as owned facilities with ownership costs being recognized instead of lease costs. (3-19-07)
b. Facilities with leases entered into prior to March 30, 1981, will not be subject to reimbursement
according to the provisions of Subsections 275.01 or 275.02 of these rules. Their property rental rate per day of care
will be the sum of the annualized allowed lease costs and the other annualized property costs for assets on hand as of
January 1, 1985, exclusive of taxes and insurance when paid separately, divided by total patient days in the period
June 30, 1983, through July 1, 1984. (3-19-07)
i. Effective July 1, 1989, the property rental rates of leased nursing facilities with leases entered into
prior to March 30, 1981, may be adjusted to compensate for increased property costs resulting from facility
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 278 Page 67
modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1,
1985, if the cost would be sufficient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more according to Subsection
275.01.d.i. of these rules. The rate will be revised after the completion of such modifications and will be the greater of
the property rental rate previously allowed under Subsection 275.03, or the actual per diem property costs for the
amortization, depreciation, and interest not applicable to the modifications for the reporting period in which the
modifications were completed, plus the per diem of the first year amortization of the modification expenses using the
American Hospital Association guideline useful life of lives. However, no such rate change will increase the
allowable property rental rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous rate and the
property rental rate that would be allowed for a new building at the time of the proposed rate revision. (3-19-07)
ii. Where such leases contain provisions that bind the lessee to accept an increased rate,
reimbursement will be at a rate per day of care which reflects the increase in the lease rate. (3-19-07)
iii. Where such leases bind the lessee to the lease and allow the rate to be renegotiated, reimbursement
will be at a rate per day of care which reflects an annual increase in the lease rate not to exceed the increase in the
consumer price index for renters’ costs. After April 1, 1985, if such a lease is terminated or if the lease allows the
lessee the option to terminate other than by an option to purchase the facility, the property rental rate will become the
amount “R” determined by the formula in Subsection 275.01 of these rules as of the date on which the lease is or
could be terminated. (3-19-07)
04. Sale of a Facility. In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, the buyer will receive
the property rental rate of Subsection 275.01 of these rules, except in the event of a forced sale or except in the event
of a first sale of a facility receiving a “grandfathered rate” after June 30, 1991, whereupon the property rental rate of
the new owner will be computed as if no sale had taken place. (3-19-07)
05. Forced Sale of a Facility. In the event of a forced sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, where the
seller has been receiving a grandfathered rate, the buyer will receive a rate based upon his incurred property costs,
exclusive of taxes and insurance, for the twelve (12) months following the sale, divided by the facility’s total patient
days for that period, or the property rental rate, not modified by Section 275 of these rules, whichever is higher, but
not exceeding the rate that would be due the seller. (3-19-07)
276. -- 277. (RESERVED)
278. NURSING FACILITY: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR.
In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid patients in cases where a facility is not maintaining
reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occupancy adjustment will be made against the costs
that are used to calculate the property rental rate; however adjustment will be made against all other property costs.
The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07)
01. Occupancy Levels. If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eighty percent (80%)
of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not including cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated
based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property costs and property rental rates are defined in Section
013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the
resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowable fixed costs. (3-19-07)
02. Occupancy Adjustment. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity will be
computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during the period
being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except
where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for nonroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly
constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity
has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupancy will be lowered by the amount of capacity being
converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capacity for a new facility will be based on the number of
beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capacity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities.
 (3-19-07)
03. Fixed Costs. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be considered all allowable
and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categories. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 279 Page 68
04. Change in Designed Capacity. In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a
facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the change and subsequent to the change will be computed and
each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capacity is increased, the increased number of beds will not be
subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months following their licensure. (3-19-07)
05. New Facility. In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, the first six (6) months
occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07)
279. NURSING FACILITY: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION.
Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility
subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has been reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an
amount in excess of their net book value, depreciation so reimbursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility
in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. (3-19-07)
01. Amount Recaptured. Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a depreciated facility takes
place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to
January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the first five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will
be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciation taken. (3-19-07)
02. Time Frame. Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the
facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years from the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the
total amount being recaptured for each year after such date. (3-19-07)
280. NURSING FACILITY: REPORTING SYSTEM.
The objective of the reporting requirements is to provide a uniform system of periodic reports which will allow:
 (3-19-07)
01. Basis for Reimbursement. A basis of provider reimbursement approximating actual costs.
 (3-19-07)
02. Disclosure. Adequate financial disclosure. (3-19-07)
03. Statistical Resources. Statistical resources, as a basis for measurement of reasonable cost and
comparative analysis. (3-19-07)
04. Criteria. Criteria for evaluating policies and procedures. (3-19-07)

Section 282 Page 69
02. Special Reports. Special reports may be required. Specific instructions will be issued, based upon
the circumstance. (3-19-07)

public accountant. (3-19-07)
05. Reporting by Chain Organizations or Related Party Providers. PRM, Section 2141.7, prohibits
the filing of combined or consolidated cost reports as a basis for cost reimbursement. Each facility so related must file
a separate set of reports. These cost reports will be required for each level of organization that allocates expenses to
the provider. Consolidated financial statements will be considered supplementary information and are not acceptable
as fulfilling the primary reporting requirements. (3-19-07)

change of management or ownership occurs, the following requirements must be met: (3-19-07)
a. Outgoing management or administration must file an adjusted-period cost report if they are being
reimbursed on a retrospective basis at the time of the charge. This report must meet the criteria for annual cost
reports, except that it must be filed not later than sixty (60) days after the change in management or ownership for the
purpose of computing a final program settlement. (3-19-07)

282. NURSING FACILITY: REPORTING PERIOD.
For purposes of nursing facility rate setting, cost report periods of less than six (6) months will not be used. If a
provider changes their fiscal year-end or experiences a change in ownership, the last cost report filed by that facility
that is greater than six (6) months will be used until a cost report exceeding six (6) months is received from the new
owner, or is based on the new fiscal year. (3-19-07)

deadline. A written decision will be rendered in writing within ten (10) days. (3-19-07)
284. NURSING FACILITY: FAILURE TO FILE.
Failure to submit timely reports may result in a reduction in the interim rate. Failure to file the required cost reports,
including required supplemental information, unless a waiver is granted, may result in a reduction of ten percent
(10%) in the provider's interim rate(s) the first day of the month following the deadline date. Continued failure to

respective type and intensity of the services furnished under the care of the hospice. The five (5) rates are prospective
rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the “cap” on overall payments, the
service intensity add-on, and the limitation on payments for inpatient care, if applicable. A description of the payment
for each level of care is described in Subsections 456.01 through 456.04 of these rules. (1-1-16)T
01. Routine Home Care. The hospice provider will be paid one (1) of two (2) routine home care rates
for each day the patient is in residence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. The
rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day. The
two-rate payment methodology will result in a higher based payment for days one (1) through sixty (60) of hospice
care and a reduced rate for days sixty-one (61) to end-of-care. If a participant leaves hospice care and then later is
placed back on hospice care, regardless of hospice provider, a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services is
required in order for the routine home care rate to be paid at the higher base payment rate. If there is not a minimum
of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services being provided, the hospice provider will be paid at the rate for which the
participant is qualified. (1-1-16)T

period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires continuous care which is primarily nursing care to achieve

licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8)
hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four (24) hour day which begins and ends at midnight. This care need
not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basis to enable the person to
remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished,
the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. (3-19-07)
03. Inpatient Respite Care. The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day that
the participant is in an approved inpatient facility and is receiving respite care. Payment for respite care may be made
for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any
monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subsequent day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine,
continuous, or general inpatient rate. (3-19-07)
04. General Inpatient Care. Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is
provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the participant receives hospice general
inpatient care except as described in Section 458 of these rules. (3-19-07)
a. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is
to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the patient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either
general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (3-19-07)
b. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice payment rates are the same as the Medicare hospice
rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medicare coinsurance amounts. Under the Medicaid hospice
benefit, no cost sharing may be imposed with respect to hospice services rendered to Medicaid participants.

Section 457 Page 109
c. Obligation of continuing care. After the participant’s hospice benefit expires, the patient’s
Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must continue to provide that participant’s care until the patient
expires or until the participant revokes the election of hospice care. (3-19-07)
05. Service Intensity Add-On. For hospice services with dates of service on and after January 1, 2016,
a service intensity add-on payment will be made for a visit by a registered nurse (RN) or social worker when provided
in the last seven (7) days of life. Payment for the service intensity add-on is in addition to the routine home care rate
and is calculated by multiplying the continuous home care rate per fifteen (15) minutes by the number of units for the
combined visits for the day. Payment must not exceed sixteen (16) units per day, and is adjusted for geographic
differences in wages. Phone time for a provider's social worker is not eligible for a service intensity add-on payment.
 (1-1-16)T
457. HOSPICE: LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS FOR INPATIENT CARE.
Payments to a hospice for inpatient care must be limited according to the number of days of inpatient care furnished
to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period beginning November 1st of each year and ending October
31st of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days (both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care)
may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid
participants during the same period by the designated hospice or its contracted agent(s). (3-19-07)
01. For Purposes of Computation. If it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be paid, any
days for which the hospice receives payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations
on payment for inpatient days are as follows: (3-19-07)
a. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculated by multiplying the total
number of a provider’s Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). (3-19-07)
b. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospice patients is less than or equal to the
maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then no adjustment is made.
 (3-19-07)
c. If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maximum number of allowable inpatient
days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then the payment limitation will be determined by: (3-19-07)
i. Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of
inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care that was made. (3-19-07)
ii. Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate. (3-19-07)
iii. Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 457.01.c.i. and 457.01.c.ii. of these rules. (3-19-07)
iv. Comparing the amount in Subsection 457.01.c.iii. of these rules with interim payments made to the
hospice for inpatient care during the “cap period.” (3-19-07)
02. The amount by which interim payments for inpatient care exceeds the amount calculated as in
Section 459 of these rules is due from the hospice. (3-19-07)
458. HOSPICE: PAYMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES.
The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement to the hospice for the costs of all covered services
related to the treatment of the participant’s terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities
performed by physicians who are employees of or working under arrangements made with the hospice. These
activities would generally be performed by the physician serving as the medical director and the physician member of
the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include participation in the establishment of plans of care,
supervision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing
policies. The costs for these services are included in the reimbursement rates for routine home care, continuous home
care, and inpatient respite care. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 459 Page 110
01. Hospice Employed Physician Direct Patient Service. Reimbursement for a hospice employed
physician’s direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual
Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will be billed by the hospice
under the hospice provider number and, the related payments will be counted in determining whether the overall
hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded. The only physician services to be billed by a
hospice for such services are direct patient care services. Laboratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice
daily rate. (3-19-07)
02. Volunteer Physician Services. Volunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid
reimbursement with the following exceptions: (3-19-07)
a. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a volunteer physician for specific direct patient care
services which are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospice must have a liability to reimburse the physician for
those services rendered. In determining whether a service is provided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not
distinguish which services are provided voluntarily on the basis of the patient’s ability to pay. (3-19-07)
b. Reimbursement for an independent physician’s direct patient services which are not rendered by a
hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician
services. These services will not be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and they will not be
counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded.
The only services to be billed by an attending physician are the physician’s personal professional services. Costs for
services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on the attending physician’s billed charges to the
Medicaid program. The aforementioned charges are included in the daily rates paid and are expressly the
responsibility of the hospice. (3-19-07)
459. HOSPICE: CAP ON OVERALL REIMBURSEMENT.
Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hospice cap period per Subsection 451.05 of these rules.
The total payments made for services furnished to Medicaid participants during this period will be compared to the
“cap amount” for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (3-19-07)
01. Overall Cap. The overall cap will be compared to reimbursement after the inpatient limitation is
computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospice. (3-19-07)
02. Total Payment for Services. Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid participants
during this period means all payments for services rendered during the cap year, regardless of when payment is
actually made. (3-19-07)
03. Calculation of Cap Amount. The “cap amount” is calculated by multiplying the number of
participants electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500). This
amount will be adjusted for each subsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to reflect the percentage increase
or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be adjusted as per Subsection 459.07 of these rules. (3-19-
07)
04. Computation and Application of Cap Amount. The computation and application of the “cap
amount” is made by the Department after the end of the cap period. (3-19-07)
05. Report Number of Medicaid Participants. The hospice must report the number of Medicaid
participants electing hospice care during the period to the Department. (3-19-07)
a. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of the cap period: and (3-19-07)
b. If the participant is transferred to a non-certified hospice no payment to the non-certified hospice
will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete participant benefit period in their cap amount.
 (3-19-07)
06. Certified in Mid-Month. If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap amount
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 460 Page 111
based on the number of days falling within each cap period would be used. (3-19-07)
07. Adjustment of the Overall Cap. Cap amounts in each hospice’s cap period will be adjusted to
reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices during a participant’s election period. The proportion of
each hospice’s days of service to the total number of hospice days rendered to the participant during their election
period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each hospice’s adjusted cap amount. (3-19-07)
a. After each cap period has ended, the Department will calculate the overall cap within a reasonable
time for each hospice participating in the Idaho Medicaid Program. (3-19-07)
b. Each hospice’s cap amount will be computed as follows: (3-19-07)
i. The share of the “cap amount” that each hospice is allowed will be based on the proportion of total
covered days provided by each hospice in the “cap period.” (3-19-07)
ii. The proportion determined in Section 457 of these rules for each certified hospice will be
multiplied by the “cap amount” specified for the “cap period” in which the participant first elected hospice. (3-19-
07)
c. The participant must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the
previous year through September 27 of the current cap year in order to be counted as an electing Medicaid participant
during the current cap year. (3-19-07)
08. Additional Amount for Nursing Facility Residents. An additional per diem amount will be paid
for “room and board” of hospice residents in a certified nursing facility receiving routine or continuous care services.
In this context, the term “room and board” includes all assistance in the activities of daily living, in socializing
activities, administration of medication, maintaining the cleanliness of a resident’s room, and supervision and
assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribed therapies. The additional payments and the related
days are not subject to the caps specified in Sections 457 and 459 of these rules. The room and board rate will be
ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of
service on which the participant was a resident of that facility. (3-19-07)
460. HOSPICE: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME.
Where a participant is determined eligible for medical assistance participation in the cost of long term care, the
Department must reduce its payments for all costs of the hospice benefit, including the supplementary amounts for
room and board, by an amount determined according to Section 227 of these rules. (3-19-07)

(b) results in substantial functional
limitations in three (3) or more of the
following major life activities:
“Results in” means that the substantial limitation must be because of the
impairment. A “substantial” limitation is one in which the total effect of the
limitation results in the need for a “combination and sequence of special
interdisciplinary, or generic care, treatment or other services that need to
be individually planned and coordinated.” Listed below are standards for
substantial functional limitations in each major life area.
Age 3 through Adult: A score of 2 standard deviations below the mean
creates a presumption of a functional limitation.
Birth to Age 3: The following criteria must be utilized to determine a
substantial functional limitations for children under 3:
a. The child scores 30% below age norm; or
b. The child exhibits a 6 month delay; or
c. The child scores 2 standard deviations below the mean.
self care;
Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when the person
requires physical or non-physical assistance in performing eating,
hygiene, grooming, or health care skills, or when the time required for a
person to perform these skills him/her self is so substantial as to impair
his ability to conduct other activities of daily living or retain employment.
Birth to Age 21: A functional limitation is manifest when the child's skills
are limited according to age-appropriate responses such that the parent,
caregiver, or school personnel is required to provide care that is
substantially beyond that typically required for a child of the same age
(such as excessive time lifting, diapering, supervision).
receptive and expressive language;
Age 3 through Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when
a person is unable to communicate effectively without the aid of a third
person, a person with special skills, or without an assistive device (such
as sign language).
Birth to Age 3: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when they
have been diagnosed by a qualified professional who determines that the
child performs 30% below age norm (adjusted for prematurity up to 2
years) or demonstrates at least 2 standard deviations below the mean in
either area or 1 1/2 below in both areas of language development.
learning;
Birth through Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when
cognition, retention, reasoning, visual or aural communications, or other
learning processes or mechanisms are impaired to the extent that special
(interventions that are beyond those that an individual normally needs to
learn) intervention is required for the development of social, self care,
language, academic, or vocational skills.
mobility;
Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when fine or gross
motor skills are impaired to the extent that the assistance of another
person or an assistive device is required for movement from place to
place.
Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation would be measured by an age
appropriate instrument which compares the child's skills for postural
control and movement and coordinated use of the small muscles with
those skills expected of children of the same age.

503. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY DETERMINATION: TEST INSTRUMENTS.
A variety of standardized test instruments are available. Tests used to determine a developmental disability must
reflect the current functional status of the individual being evaluated. Tests over one (1) year old must be verified to
reflect the current status of the individual by an appropriate professional. Instruments designed only for screening
purposes must not be used to determine eligibility. (3-19-07)
01. Test Instruments For Adults. Unless contra-indicated, the following test instruments or
self-direction;
Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when a person
requires assistance in managing his personal finances, protecting his self
interest, or making decisions that may affect his well being.
Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation is manifest when the child is
unable to help his self or cooperate with others age appropriate
assistance to meet personal needs, learn new skills, follow rules, and
adapt to environments.
capacity for independent living; or
Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when, for a person's
own safety or well-being, supervision or assistance is required, at least
on a daily basis, in the performance of health maintenance,
housekeeping, budgeting, or leisure time activities and in the utilization of
community resources.
Birth to Age 21: A substantial limitation would be measured by an ageappropriate instrument which compares the child's personal
independence and social responsibility expected of children of
comparable age and cultural group.
economic self-sufficiency; and
Adult: A substantial functional limitation is manifest when a person is
unable to perform the tasks necessary for regular employment or is
limited in productive capacity to the extent that his earned annual income,
after extraordinary expenses occasioned by the disability, is insufficient
for self-support.
Age 5 to Age 21: Use the pre-vocational area of a standardized functional
assessment to document a limitation in this area.
Birth to Age 5: A substantial limitation in this area is evidenced by the
child's eligibility for SSI, early intervention, or early childhood special
education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
AND
(c) reflects the needs for a combination
and sequence of special,
interdisciplinary or generic care,
treatment or other services which are
of life-long or extended duration and
individually planned and coordinated.
Age 5 through Adult: Life-long or extended duration means the
developmental disability is one which has the reasonable likelihood of
continuing for a protracted period of time, including a reasonable
likelihood that it will continue throughout life.
Birth to Age 5: The expected duration may be frequently unclear.
Therefore, determination of eligibility by a multi-disciplinary team for early
intervention services through SSI, an IFSP, child study team or early
childhood special education services through an IEP will be an indicator
of this criteria.

addendum to the plan. These adjustments must be based on a change to a cost, addition of a service or increase to a
service, or a change of provider. Additional assessments or information may be clinically necessary. Adjustment of
the plan of service is subject to prior authorization by the Department. (3-29-12)
11. Community Crisis Supports. Community crisis supports are interventions for participants who
have been determined eligible for developmental disability services and who are at risk of losing housing,
employment or income, or are at risk of incarceration, physical harm, family altercation, or other emergencies.
Community crisis support may be authorized the following business day after the intervention if there is a
documented need for immediate intervention, no other means of support are available, and the services are

514. ADULT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES PRIOR AUTHORIZATION: PROVIDER
REIMBURSEMENT.
Providers are reimbursed on a fee for service basis based on a participant budget. (3-29-12)
01. Individualized Budget Beginning on October 1, 2006. Beginning October 1, 2006, for DD
waiver participants, and beginning January 1, 2007, for all other adult DD participants, the Department sets an
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 514 Page 122
individualized budget for each participant according to an individualized measurement of the participant's functional
abilities, behavioral limitations, and medical needs, related to the participant's disability. Using these specific
participant factors, the budget-setting methodology will correlate a participant's characteristics with the participant's
individualized budget amount, so participants with higher needs will be assigned a higher individualized budget
amount. (3-29-12)
a. The Department notifies each participant of his set budget amount as part of the eligibility
determination process or annual redetermination process. The notification will include how the participant may
appeal the set budget amount. (3-29-12)
b. Individualized budgets will be re-evaluated annually. At the request of the participant, the
Department will also re-evaluate the set budget amount when there are documented changes in the participant's
condition resulting in a need for services that meet medical necessity criteria, and this is not reflected on the current
inventory of individual needs. (3-29-12)
02. Residential Habilitation - Supported Living Acuity-Based Levels of Support. Reimbursement
for residential habilitation - supported living is based on the participant's assessed level of support need. All plans of
service that include supported living must include community integration goals that provide for maintained or
enhanced independence, quality of life, and self-determination. As a participant’s independence increases and he is
less dependent on supports, he must transition to less intense supports. (3-19-07)
a. High support is for those participants who require twenty-four (24) hour per day supports and
supervision and have an SIB-R Support Level of Pervasive, Extensive, or Frequent. High support allows for a blend
of one-to-one and group staffing. Participants authorized at the high support daily rate will not be authorized to
receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These services are included in
the high support daily rate. (3-19-07)
b. Intense support is for those exceptional participants who require intense, twenty-four (24) hour per
day supports and supervision. This support level typically requires one-on-one staffing, but requests for a blend of
one-on-one and group staffing will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Participants authorized at the intense support
daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical
transportation. These services are included in the intense support daily rate. To qualify for this level of support,
participants must be evaluated to meet one or more of the following criteria: (3-19-07)
i. Recent felony convictions or charges for offenses related to the serious injury or harm of another
person. These participants must have been placed in a supported living setting directly from incarceration or directly
after being diverted from incarceration. (3-19-07)
ii. History of predatory sexual offenses and are at high risk to re-offend based on a sexual offender
risk assessment completed by an appropriate professional. (3-19-07)
iii. Documented, sustained history of serious aggressive behavior showing a pattern of causing harm to
themselves or others. The serious aggressive behavior must be such that the threat or use of force on another person
makes that person reasonably fear bodily harm. The participant must also have the capability to carry out such a
threat. The frequency and intensity of this type of aggressive behavior must require continuous monitoring to prevent
injury to themselves or others. (3-19-07)
iv. Chronic or acute medical conditions that are so complex or unstable that one-to-one staffing is
required to provide frequent interventions and constant monitoring. Without this intervention and monitoring the
participant would require placement in a nursing facility, hospital, or ICF/ID with twenty-four (24) hour on-site
nursing. Verification of the complex medical condition and the need for this level of service requires medical
documentation. (3-19-07)
c. Hourly support is for those individuals that do not meet criteria for either high or intense supports
or those individuals who qualify for a daily rate but whose needs can be met with less than twenty-four (24) per day
support. The combination of hourly supported living, developmental therapy, community supported employment, and
adult day care will not be authorized to exceed the maximum set daily amount established by the Department except
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 515 Page 123
when all of the following conditions are met: (3-19-07)
i. The participant is eligible to receive the high support daily rate; (3-19-07)
ii. Community supported employment is included in the plan and is causing the combination to
exceed the daily limit; (3-19-07)
iii. There is documentation that the Person-Centered Planning team has explored other options
including using lower cost services and natural supports; and (3-19-07)
iv. The participant's health and safety needs will be met using hourly services despite having been
assessed to qualify for twenty-four (24) hour care. (3-19-07)
515. ADULT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES: QUALITY ASSURANCE AND
IMPROVEMENT.
01. Quality Assurance. Quality Assurance consists of audits and reviews to assure compliance with
the Department's rules and regulations. If problems are identified during the review or audit, the provider must
implement a corrective action plan within forty-five (45) days after the results are received. The Department may
terminate authorization of service for providers who do not comply with the corrective action plan. (3-19-07)
02. Quality Improvement. The Department may gather and utilize information from providers to
evaluate customer satisfaction, participant satisfaction, outcomes monitoring, care management, quality assurance,
quality improvement activities, and health and safety. These findings may lead to quality improvement activities to
improve provider processes and outcomes for participants. (3-19-07)
03. Exception Review. The Department will complete an exception review of plans or addendums
requesting services that exceed the assigned budget authorized by the assessor. Requests for these services will be
authorized when one (1) of the following conditions are met: (4-11-15)
a. Services are needed to assure the health and safety of participants who require residential high or
intense supported living, and the services requested on the plan or addendum are required based on medical necessity
as defined in Subsection 012.14 of these rules. (4-11-15)
b. Supported employment services as defined in Section 703 of these rules are needed for the
participant to obtain or maintain employment. The request must be submitted on the Department-approved Exception
Review Form and is reviewed and approved based on the following: (4-11-15)
i. A supported employment service recommendation must be submitted that includes: recommended
amount of service, level of support needed, employment goals, and a transition plan. When the participant is
transitioned from the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (IDVR) services, the recommendation must be
completed by IDVR. When a participant is in an established job, the recommendation must be completed by the
supported employment agency identified on the plan of service or addendum; (4-11-15)
ii. The participant’s plan of service was developed by the participant and his person-centered planning
team and includes a goal for supported employment services. Prior to the submission of an exception review with an
addendum, a comprehensive review of all services on the participant’s plan must occur. The participant’s combination
of services must support the increase or addition of supported employment services; and (4-11-15)
iii. An acknowledgement signed by the participant and his legal guardian, if one exists, that additional
budget dollars approved to purchase supported employment services must not be reallocated to purchase any other
Medicaid service. (4-11-15)
04. Concurrent Review. The Department will obtain the necessary information to determine that
participants continue to meet eligibility criteria, services continue to be clinically necessary, services continue to be
the choice of the participant, and services constitute appropriate care to warrant continued authorization or need for
the service. (3-19-07)
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10

Section 520 Page 124
05. Abuse, Fraud, or Substandard Care. Reviewers finding suspected abuse, fraud, or substandard
care must refer their findings for investigation to the Department and other regulatory or law enforcement agencies

the Bureau, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Bureau.
 (3-19-07)
03. Direct Care Staff. Direct Care staff in an ICF/ID are defined as the present on-duty staff calculated
over all shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period for each defined residential living unit. Direct care staff in an ICF/ID
include those employees whose primary duties include the provision of hands-on, face-to-face contact with the
participants of the facility. This includes both regular and live-in/sleep-over staff. It excludes professionals such as
psychologists, nurses, and others whose primary job duties are not the provision of direct care, as well as managers/
supervisors who are responsible for the supervision of staff. (3-19-07)
04. Direct Care Staffing Levels. The reasonable level of direct care staffing provided to a participant
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 588 Page 136
in an ICF/ID setting will be dependent upon the level of involvement and the need for services and supports of the
participant as determined by the Department. Level of involvement relates to the severity of a participant's
intellectual disability. Those levels, in decreasing level of severity, are: profound, severe, moderate, and mild.
Staffing levels will be subject to the following constraints: (3-19-07)
a. Direct care staffing for a severely and profoundly intellectually disabled participant residing in an
ICF/ID must be a maximum of sixty-eight point twenty five (68.25) hours per week. (3-19-07)
b. Direct care staffing for a moderately intellectually disabled participant residing in an ICF/ID must
be limited to a maximum of fifty-four point six (54.6) hours per week. (3-19-07)
c. Direct care staffing for a mildly intellectually disabled participant residing in an ICF/ID must be
limited to a maximum of thirty four point one two five (34.125) hours per week. (3-19-07)
05. Direct Care Staff Hours. The annual sum total level of allowable direct care staff hours for each
residential living unit will be determined in the aggregate as the sum total of the level of staffing allowable for each
resident residing in that residential living unit as determined in Subsection 587.04 of these rules. (3-19-07)
06. Phase-In Period. If enactment of Subsection 587.04 of these rules requires a facility to reduce its
level of direct care staffing, a six (6) month phase-in period will be allowed from the date of the enactment of this
section, without any resulting disallowances. Should disallowances result, the hourly rate of direct care staff used in
determining disallowances will be the weighted average of the hourly rates paid to a facility's direct care staff, plus
the associated benefits, at the end of the phase-in period. (3-19-07)
07. Exceptions. Should a provider be able to show convincing evidence documenting that the annual
aggregate direct care hours as allowed under this section will compromise their ability to supply adequate care to the
participants, as required by federal regulations and state rules, within an ICF/ID residential living unit and that other
less costly options would not alleviate the situation, the Department will approve an additional amount of direct care
hours sufficient to meet the extraordinary needs. This adjustment will only be available up through September 30,
1996. (3-19-07)
588. ICF/ID: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT.
01. Payment Methodology. ICF/ID facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with the methodology
listed in Sections 588 through 633 of these rules. (3-19-07)
02. Date of Discharge. Payment by the Department for the cost of ICF/ID care is to include the date of
the participant’s discharge only if the discharge occurred after 3 p.m. and is not discharged to a related provider. If a
Medicaid patient dies in an ICF/ID, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an admission
and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. (3-19-07)
589. ICF/ID: REASONABLE COST PRINCIPLES.
To be allowable, costs must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that
providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to
beneficiaries will result. (3-19-07)
01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles. (3-19-07)
a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance with rules found in the Provider
Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modified by the exceptions contained herein, is used
to identify cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost Report. (3-19-07)
i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services, including
normal standby costs. (3-19-07)
ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the
program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 590 Page 137
be paid by the program. (3-19-07)
b. Costs may vary from one institution to another because of a variety of factors. It is the intent of the
program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs
exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to provisions of Title 56, Chapter 1, Idaho Code, or are
unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07)
c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid to the extent they are reasonable is the
expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and that its actual operating costs do not exceed what a
prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or service. (3-19-07)
d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers incur, in the absence of clear evidence
that the higher costs were unavoidable, the excess costs are not reimbursable. (3-19-07)
02. Costs Related to Patient Care. These include all necessary and proper costs in developing and
maintaining the operation of patient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs
which are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity. They include costs such as
depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance costs, administrative costs, costs of employee pension
plans, normal standby costs, and others. Example: Depreciation is a method of systematically recognizing the
declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the asset is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and
necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed based on property costs according to other provisions of
this chapter. Property related expenses are likewise allowable. (3-19-07)
03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care. Costs not related to patient care are costs which are not
appropriate or necessary and proper in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and
activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursable costs. Example: Fines are imposed for late
remittance of federal withholding taxes. Such fines are not related to patient care, are not necessary, and are not
reflective of prudent cost conscious management. Therefore, such fines and penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07)
04. Form and Substance. Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financial transactions
will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the transaction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply
with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are contracts which are executed in the form of a lease.
The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type
lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the property. If a lease contract is found to be in
substance a purchase, the related payments are not allowable as lease or rental expense. (3-19-07)
590. ICF/ID: ALLOWABLE COSTS.
The following definitions and explanations apply to allowable costs: (3-19-07)
01. Accounts Collection. The costs related to the collection of past due program related accounts, such
as legal and bill collection fees, are allowable. (3-19-07)
02. Auto and Travel Expense. Maintenance and operating costs of a vehicle used for patient care
purposes and travel expense related to patient care are reimbursable. The allowance for mileage reimbursement

reimbursement is limited to the amount that would be allowed by the state for a state employee. (3-19-07)
03. Bad Debts. Payments for efforts to collect past due Title XIX and Title XXI accounts are
reimbursable. This may include the fees for lawyers and collection agencies. Other allowances for bad debt and bad

(100%) reimbursable as provided in PRM, Section 300. (3-19-07)
04. Bank and Finance Charges. Charges for routine maintenance of accounts are allowable. Penalties
for late payments, overdrafts, etc., are not allowable. (3-19-07)
05. Compensation of Owners. An owner may receive reasonable compensation for services subject to
the limitations in this chapter, to the extent the services are actually performed, documented, reasonable, ordinary,
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 590 Page 138
necessary, and related to patient care. Allowable compensation cannot exceed the amount necessary to attract
assistance from parties not related to the owner to perform the same services. The nature and extent of services must
be supported by adequate documentation including hours performing the services. Where an average industry wide
rate for a particular function can be determined, reported allowable owner compensation cannot exceed the average
rate. Compensation to owners, or persons related to owners, providing administrative services is further limited by
provisions in Section 597 of these rules. In determining the reasonableness of compensation for services paid to an
owner or a person related to an owner, compensation is the total of all benefits or remuneration paid to or primarily
for the benefit of the owner regardless of form or characterization. It includes, but is not limited to, the following:
 (3-19-07)
a. Salaries wages, bonuses and benefits which are paid or are accrued and paid for the reporting

12. Food. Costs of raw food, not including vending machine items, are allowable. The provider is only
reimbursed for costs of food purchased for patients. Costs for nonpatient meals are nonreimbursable. If the costs for
nonpatient meals cannot be identified, the revenues from these meals are used to offset the costs of the raw food.
 (3-19-07)
13. Home Office Costs. Reasonable costs allocated by related entities for home office services are
allowable in their applicable cost centers. (3-19-07)
14. Insurance. Premiums for insurance on assets or for liability purposes, including vehicles, are

Section 591 Page 139
15. Interest. Interest on working capital loans is an allowable administrative expense. When property
is reimbursed based on cost, interest on related debt is allowable. However, interest payable to related entities is not
normally an allowable expense. Penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07)
16. Lease or Rental Payments. Payments for the property cost of the lease or rental of land, buildings,
and equipment are allowable according to Medicare reasonable cost principles when property is reimbursed based on
cost for leases entered into before March 30, 1981. Such leases entered into on or after March 30, 1981, will be
reimbursed in the same manner as an owned asset. The cost of leases related to home offices and ICF/ID day
treatment services will not be reported as property costs and will be allowable based on reasonable cost principles

standard deviations above the mean of the most recently reported property insurance costs, as used for rate setting
purposes, per licensed bed of all facilities in the reimbursement class of the end of a facility's fiscal year. (3-19-07)
21. Repairs and Maintenance. Costs of maintenance and minor repairs are allowable when related to
the provision of patient care. (3-19-07)

04. Charity Allowances. Cost of free care or discounted services are nonallowable. (3-19-07)
05. Consultant Fees. Costs related to the payment of consultant fees in excess of the lowest rate
available to a facility are nonallowable. It is the provider's responsibility to make efforts to obtain the lowest rate
available to that facility. The efforts may include personally contacting possible consultants or advertising. The
lowest rate available to a facility is the lower of the actual rate paid by the facility or the lowest rate available to the
facility, as determined by departmental inquiry directly to various consultants. Costs in excess of the lowest rate
available will be disallowed effective thirty (30) days after a facility is notified, unless the provider shows by clear
and convincing evidence it would have been unable to comply with state and federal standards had the lowest rate
consultant been retained or that it tried to but was unable to retain the lowest rate consultant. This subsection in no
way limits the Department's ability to disallow excessive consultant costs under other sections of this chapter, such as
Section 589 or 595 of these rules, when applicable. (3-19-07)

597. ICF/ID: IDAHO OWNER-ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION.
Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be
limited based on the schedule in this section. (3-19-07)
01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation. The following schedule will be used in
determining the maximum amount of owner administrative compensation allowable for the calendar year ending
December 31, 2002.
 (3-19-07)
02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule. The administrative compensation schedule in this
Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in average hourly earnings in nursing and personal care
facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its successor organization or, if unavailable, another
nationally recognized forecasting firm. (3-19-07)
03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation. The maximum allowable compensation for an owner
providing administrative services is determined from the schedule in Subsection 597.01. of these rules. Allowable
compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07)
a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, all licensed beds for which the
individual provides administrative services will be counted, regardless of whether they are in the same facility.
 (3-19-07)
b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, the amounts shown on the schedule
for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limit for allowable compensation. (3-19-07)
c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to
administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate allowable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one
(51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative services may be performed by the owner and will be

allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To be allowable, hours for each type of service will be
documented. In no event will the total compensation for administrative and non-administrative duties paid to an
owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that
would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with
fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 597.01 of these rules. (3-19-07)
04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner. Compensation for persons related to an owner
will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. (3-19-07)
05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider. When an owner provides
services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be distributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for
non-owners. (3-19-07)
06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensation for Hours Actually
Worked. Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary. Total compensation must be reasonable,
and not greater than the amount for which the same services could be obtained on the open market. The standard by
which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand eighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a
party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of this chapter, and will not exceed the compensation
determined from the Administrative Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the
compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Schedule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080).
 (3-19-07)
598. -- 599. (RESERVED)
600. ICF/ID: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR.
In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid patients in cases where a facility is not maintaining
reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occupancy adjustment will be made against the costs
that are used to calculate the property rental rate; however adjustment will be made against all other property costs.
The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07)
01. Occupancy Levels. If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eighty percent (80%)
of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not including cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated
based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property costs and property rental rates are defined in Section
013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the
resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowable fixed costs. (3-19-07)
02. Occupancy Adjustment. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity will be
computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during the period
being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the facility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except
where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for nonroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly
constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity
has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupancy will be lowered by the amount of capacity being
converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capacity for a new facility will be based on the number of
beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capacity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities.
 (3-19-07)
03. Fixed Costs. For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be considered all allowable
and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categories. (3-19-07)
04. Change in Designed Capacity. In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a
facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the change and subsequent to the change will be computed and
each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capacity is increased, the increased number of beds will not be
subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months following their licensure. (3-19-07)
05. New Facility. In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, the first six (6) months
occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07)

601. ICF/ID: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION.
Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility
subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has been reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an
amount in excess of their net book value, depreciation so reimbursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility
in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. (3-19-07)
01. Amount Recaptured. Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a depreciated facility takes
place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to
January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the first five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will
be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciation taken. (3-19-07)
02. Time Frame. Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the
facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years from the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the
total amount being recaptured for each year after such date. (3-19-07)
602. ICF/ID: REPORTING SYSTEM.
The objective of the reporting requirements is to provide a uniform system of periodic reports which will allow:
 (3-19-07)
01. Basis for Reimbursement. A basis of provider reimbursement approximating actual costs.
 (3-19-07)
02. Disclosure. Adequate financial disclosure. (3-19-07)
03. Statistical Resources. Statistical resources, as a basis for measurement of reasonable cost and
comparative analysis. (3-19-07)
04. Criteria. Criteria for evaluating policies and procedures. (3-19-07)
603. ICF/ID: REPORTING SYSTEM PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION.
The provider will be required to file mandatory annual cost reports. (3-19-07)
01. Cost Report Requirements. The fiscal year end cost report filing must include: (3-19-07)
a. Annual income statement (two (2) copies); (3-19-07)
b. Balance sheet; (3-19-07)
c. Statement of ownership; (3-19-07)
d. Schedule of patient days; (3-19-07)
e. Schedule of private patient charges; (3-19-07)

c. Prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and principles of
reimbursement. (3-19-07)
d. Appropriate detail must be provided on supporting schedules or as requested. (3-19-07)
04. Preparer. It is not required that any statement be prepared by an independent, licensed or certified
public accountant. (3-19-07)
05. Reporting by Chain Organizations or Related Party Providers. PRM, Section 2141.7, prohibits
the filing of combined or consolidated cost reports as a basis for cost reimbursement. Each facility so related must file
a separate set of reports. These cost reports will be required for each level of organization that allocates expenses to
the provider. Consolidated financial statements will be considered supplementary information and are not acceptable
as fulfilling the primary reporting requirements. (3-19-07)
06. Change of Management or Ownership. To properly pay separate entities or individuals when a
change of management or ownership occurs, the following requirements will be met: (3-19-07)
a. Outgoing management or administration will file an adjusted-period cost report if it is necessary.
This report will meet the criteria for annual cost reports, except that it will be filed not later than sixty (60) days after
the change in management or ownership. (3-19-07)
b. The Department may require an appraisal at the time of a change in ownership. (3-19-07)
07. Reporting Period. When required for establishing rates, new ICF/ID providers will be required to
submit cost projections for the first year of operations. Thereafter, the normal reporting period coincides with the
provider’s standard fiscal year. If a provider withdraws from the program and subsequently re-enters, the new
provider reporting requirements will apply. (3-19-07)
604. (RESERVED)
605. ICF/ID: FILING DATES.
01. Deadlines. Deadlines for annual cost reports will be the last day of the third month following the
fiscal year end or the deadline imposed by Medicare if the provider is required to file a Medicare cost report.
 (3-19-07)
02. Waivers. A delay of thirty (30) days may be granted for annual cost reports in unusual
circumstances. Requests for such deferrals and reasons therefore must be in writing and should be made prior to the
deadline. A written decision will be rendered in writing within ten (10) days. (3-19-07)
606. ICF/ID: FAILURE TO FILE.
Failure to submit timely reports may result in a reduction in the interim rate. Failure to file the required cost reports,
including required supplemental information, unless a waiver is granted, may result in a reduction of ten percent
(10%) in the provider's interim rate(s) the first day of the month following the deadline date. Continued failure to
comply will result in complete payment suspension on the first day of the following month. When suspension or
reduction has occurred and the provider has filed the required cost reports, amounts accruing to the provider during
the period of suspension or reduction will be restored. Loss of license or certification will result in immediate
termination of reimbursement, full scope audit and settlement for the cost period. (3-19-07)
607. ICF/ID: ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.
Reports must be filed using the accrual basis and conform with generally accepted accounting principles or within
provisions of the guidelines as specified. In any case, the recorded transaction must be capable of verification by
Departmental audit. (3-19-07)

IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 623 Page 152
necessary to implement the provisions and accomplish the objectives of the payment system for ICF/ID providers.
Total payment will include the following components: Property reimbursement, capped costs, exempt costs, and
excluded costs. Except as otherwise provided in this section, rates calculated for state fiscal year 2012 (July 1, 2011

cost limit adjustments for inflation to the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Rates effective July 1,
2012, and every July 1 thereafter, will be calculated by using audited cost reports ended in the calendar year two (2)
years prior to each July 1 (July 1, 2012, rates will use cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 and so forth), with no
cost or cost limit adjustments for inflation. (4-4-13)
623. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT.
Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID property costs are reimbursed by a rental rate or based on cost. The following

the extent not inconsistent with this chapter: ICF/ID living unit property taxes, ICF/ID living unit property insurance,
and major movable equipment not related to home office or day treatment services. Reimbursement of other property
costs is included in the property rental rate. Any property cost related to home offices and day treatment services are
not considered property costs and will not be reported in the property cost portion of the cost report. These costs will
be reported in the home office and day treatment section of the cost report. Property costs, including costs which are
reimbursed based on a rental rate, will be reported in the property cost portion of the cost report. The Department may
require and utilize an appraisal to establish those components of property costs which are identified as an integral part
of an appraisal. Property costs include the following components: (3-19-07)
01. Depreciation. Allowable depreciation based on straight line depreciation. (3-19-07)

categories based on the owner's costs. (3-19-07)
624. ICF/ID: CAPPED COST.
Beginning October 1, 1996, this cost area includes all allowable costs except those specifically identified as property
costs in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. This
Section defines items and procedures to be followed in determining allowable and exempt costs and provides the
procedures for extracting cost data from historical cost reports, applying a cost forecasting market basket to project
cost forward, procedures to be followed to project costs forward, and procedures for computing the median of the
range of costs and the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07)
01. Costs Subject to the Cap. Items subject to the cap include all allowable costs except property
costs identified in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs identified in Section 627 or 628 of
these rules. Property costs related to a home office are administrative costs, will not be reported as property costs, and
are subject to the cap. (3-19-07)
02. Per Diem Costs. Costs to be included in this category will be divided by the total participant days
for the facility for the cost reporting period to arrive at allowable per diem costs. If costs for services provided some
or all non-Medicaid residents are not included in the total costs submitted, the provider must determine the costs and
combine them with the submitted costs in order that a total per diem cost for that facility can be determined both for
both the purposes of determining the ICF/ID cap and of computing final reimbursement. (3-19-07)
03. Cost Data to Determine the Cap. Cost data to be used to determine the cap for ICF/ID facilities
will be taken from each provider's most recent final cost report available sixty (60) days before the beginning of the
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 624 Page 153
period for which the cap is being set. Cost reports are final when the final audit report is issued, or earlier if the
Department informs the facility the report is final for rate setting purposes. The selected final cost report will be used
to establish the facility's prospective reimbursement rate. However, the final cost reports covering a period of less
than twelve (12) months will be included in the data for determining the cap at the option of the Department.
 (3-19-07)
04. Projection. Per diem allowable costs will be inflated forward using a cost forecasting market
basket and forecasting indices according to the same table as used for free standing facilities. (3-19-07)
a. The projection method used in Section 624 of these rules to set the cap will also be used to set non
property portions of the prospective rate which are not subject to the cap. (3-19-07)
b. Forecasting indices as developed by Data Resources, Incorporated, will be used unless they are
unavailable. In such case, indices supplied by some other nationally recognized forecaster will be used. (3-19-07)
05. Costs Which Can be Paid Directly by the Department to Non ICF/ID Providers. Costs which
can be paid directly by the Department to non ICF/ID providers are excluded from the ICF/ID prospective rates and
ICF/ID cap: (3-19-07)
a. Direct physician care costs. Physicians who provide these services must bill the Medicaid program
directly using their own provider numbers. (3-19-07)
b. Costs of services covered under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment
(EPSDT) portion of the Medicaid Program. Items such as eyeglasses and hearing aids are covered under IDAPA
16.03.09, “Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits.” Dental services provided to EPSDT participants who are under the age of
twenty-one (21) and who reside in an ICF/ID, are covered under Sections 080 through 085 of these rules. The cost of
these services is not includable as a part of ICF/ID costs. Reimbursement can be made to a professional providing
these services through his billing the Medicaid Program on his own provider number. (5-8-09)
c. Costs of services covered by other parts of the Medicaid Program. Examples of these items include
legend drugs and ambulance transportation. These items must be billed to the Medicaid Program directly by the
provider using his own provider number. (3-19-07)
06. Cost Projection. Allowable per diem costs will be projected forward from the midpoint of the Base
Period to the midpoint of the Target Period. “Base Period” is defined as the last available final cost report period.
“Target Period” is defined as the effective period of the prospective rate. Procedures for inflating these costs are as
follows: (3-19-07)
a. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed from the
beginning to the end of the Base Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant
percentages will be used to project forward allowable per diem costs for each cost category from the midpoint to the
end of the Base Period. (3-19-07)
b. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed for the period
from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. These percentages will then be used to project
forward the allowable per diem costs for each cost category, as determined in Subsection 624.06.a. of these rules,
from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. (3-19-07)
c. The percentage change for each cost category in the market basket will be computed for the
beginning to the end of the Target Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant
percentages will be used to project forward the allowable per diem costs as determined in Subsection 624.06.b. of
these rules from the beginning to the midpoint of the Target Period. (3-19-07)
07. Cost Ranking. Prior to October 1st of each year the Director will determine the that percent above
the median which will assure aggregate payments to ICF/ID providers will approximate but not exceed amounts that
would be incurred using Medicare cost principles of reimbursement. That percentage will apply to caps and rates set
after September 30th of each year. Projected per diem costs as determined in this section and subject to the cap will be
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 626 Page 154
ranked from the highest to the lowest. The cap will be set at a percent of the bed-weighted median for each rate
period. The initial cap will be set as of October 1, 1996. (3-19-07)
a. The median of the range will be computed based on the available data points being considered as
the total population of data points. (3-19-07)
b. The cap for each ICF/ID facility with a fiscal year beginning October 1, 1996, will be computed
prior to the beginning of that year. For those facilities with a fiscal year ending on a date other than September 30th,
the first cap will be computed for the period beginning October 1, 1996, and ending on the fiscal year end date.
 (3-19-07)
c. Facilities with cost reports that transcend the period from October 1, 1996, through September 30,
1997, will be retrospectively settled using the previous reimbursement system for the period of the report up to
September 30, 1996. There will not be a retrospective settlement on the portion of these cost reports attributed to
October 1, 1996 through the end of the cost report period unless provisions of Section 626 of these rules apply.
 (3-19-07)
d. Cost reports for periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996, will not be subject to retrospective
settlement except as required by other provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07)
e. A new cap and rate will be set on an annual basis for each facility the first of July every year.
 (3-19-07)
f. The cap and prospective rate will be determined and set on an annual basis for each facility July
first of every year and will not be changed by any subsequent events or information with the exception that if the
computations were found to contain mathematical or clerical errors, these errors will be corrected and the cap will be
adjusted using the corrected figures. (3-19-07)
g. Payment of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the
exclusions found in Section 628 of these rules apply. (3-19-07)
h. A facility which commences to offer participant care services as an ICF/ID on or after October 1,
1996, will be subject to retrospective settlement until the first prospective rate is set. Such facility will be subject to
the ICF/ID cap as determined in this chapter. The first prospective rate for this provider will be set by the Department
based on quarterly cost statements and final cost reports submitted for periods following the first three (3) months of
operation. This first prospective rate may be set after the beginning of the second fiscal year of the provider. For the
second year the provider will be paid a rate to be settled retrospectively unless both the Department and the provider
agree to a prospective rate or rates covering that fiscal period. (3-19-07)
625. (RESERVED)
626. ICF/ID: RETROSPECTIVE SETTLEMENT.
When retrospective settlement is applicable, it is based on allowable reimbursement in accordance with this chapter
and based on an audit report. Retrospective settlement will be subject to the same caps and limits determined for
prospective payments. (3-19-07)
01. A Provider's Failure to Meet Any of the Conditions. A provider's failure to meet any of the
conditions of participation set forth in 42 CFR 483, Subpart I, may subject that provider to retrospective
reimbursement for the fiscal year, or any portion thereof, during which the condition is not met. The provider's
projected per diem rate may be adjusted to reflect actual reimbursable costs subject to cost limits. (3-19-07)
02. A First Time Provider. A first time provider operating a new ICF/ID living unit will be subject to
a retrospective settlement for the first fiscal year and until the first subsequent period wherein a prospective rate is set
in accordance with Sections 603, 605, and 606 of these rules and this chapter. A budget based on the best available
information is required prior to opening for participant care so an interim rate can be set. (3-19-07)
03. New ICF/ID Living Unit. A new ICF/ID living unit for an existing operator is subject to first time
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 627 Page 155
facility requirements if the new living unit reflects a net increase in licensed beds, otherwise the Department may set
a prospective rate with the non-property rate components based on similar components of rates most recently paid for
the participants moving into the facility. The property rental rate will be set according to applicable provisions of this
chapter. (3-19-07)
04. Change of Ownership of Existing ICF/ID Living Unit. Where there is a change of ownership of
an existing ICF/ID living unit, the provider operating the ICF/ID living unit will not receive an adjustment of the
provider's prospective rate except that the property rental portion of the rate will be adjusted subject to property rental
provisions of this chapter. However, new facility reporting requirements and the cap will apply. (3-19-07)
05. Fraudulent or False Claims. Providers who have made fraudulent or false claims are subject to
retrospective settlement as determined by the Department. (3-19-07)
06. Excluded Costs. Excluded costs may be retrospectively settled according to the provisions of
Section 247 of these rules. (3-19-07)
627. ICF/ID: EXEMPT COSTS.
Exempt costs are not subject to the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07)
01. Day Treatment Services. As specified in this Section, the cost of day treatment services may be
reimbursed in this category and may not be subject to the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07)
a. This category includes the direct costs of labor, benefits, contracted services, property, utilities and
supplies for such services up to the limitations provided in this Subsection. (3-19-07)
b. When a school or another agency or entity is responsible for or pays for services provided to a
participant regularly during normal working hours on weekdays, no costs will be assigned to this category for such
services. The Department will not reimburse for the cost of services which are paid for or should be paid for by an
other agency. (3-19-07)
c. When ICF/ID day treatment services are performed for participants in a licensed Developmental
Disability Center, the allowable cost of such services will be included in this category, but not more than the amount
that would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule for individual or group therapy for similar services.
Amounts incurred or paid by the ICF/ID in excess of what would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule
for like services are not allowable costs and will be reported as non-reimbursable. (3-19-07)
d. For day treatment services provided in a location other than a certified developmental disability
center, the maximum amount reportable in this category will also be limited. Total costs for such services reported by
each provider in this category will be limited to the number of hours, up to thirty (30) hours per week per participant,
of individual or group developmental therapy times the hourly rate that would be paid according to the most recent
Department fee schedule for the same services if provided in a developmental disability center. Costs in excess of the
limits determined in this Subsection will be classified and reported as subject to the ICF/ID cap. Initial rates
established under the prospective system effective October 1, 1996, and not later than October 1, 1997, will not
include a limitation of day treatment costs based on the hourly rate, when the hours of individual or group therapy
were not obtained or audited by the Department at the time the rate was published. However, if a provider believes
that the day treatment cost used to establish the day treatment portion of its prospective rate was misstated for rates
set for periods beginning October 1, 1996, through rates beginning October 1, 1997, revisions to the prospective rate
may be made to the extent the provider demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Department, that the cost used was
misstated. Such a revision will be considered only if the provider requests a revision and provides adequate
documentation within sixty (60) days of the date the rate was set. At the option of the Department it may negotiate
fixed rates for these day treatment services. Such rates will be set so the aggregate related payments are lower than
would be paid with a limitation based on schedules used for licensed Developmental Disability Centers. (3-19-07)
e. Financial data including expenses and labor hours incurred by or on behalf of the provider in
providing day treatment services, must be identifiable and separate from the costs of other facility operations.
Reasonable property costs related to day treatment services and not included in the property rental rate, will be
separately identified, will be reported as day treatment services costs, and will not include property costs otherwise
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 628 Page 156
reimbursed. Property costs related to day treatment services will be separately identified as not related to living unit
costs by a final audit determination issued prior to October 1, 1996, or will be separate and distinct from any property
used for ICF/ID services which are or were day treatment services. (3-19-07)
f. In the event a provider has a change in the number of participants requiring day treatment services,
the prospective rate may be adjusted by the Department to reflect a change in costs related to such a change.
Providers receiving such changes may be required to provide added documentation to the Department to assure that
further changes can be identified and the prospective rate adjusted accordingly. (3-19-07)
02. Major Movable Equipment. Costs related to major movable equipment, as defined in this chapter
will be exempt from the ICF/ID cap and will be reimbursed prospectively based on Medicare principles of cost
reimbursement. (3-19-07)
628. ICF/ID: COSTS EXCLUDED FROM THE CAP.
Certain costs may be excluded from the ICF/ID cap, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the
Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rate as provided in this Section to assure equitable
reimbursement: (3-19-07)
01. Increases of More Than One Dollar Per Participant Day in Costs. Increases of more than one
dollar ($1) per participant day in costs otherwise subject to the cap incurred by a facility as a result of changes in State
or Federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cost report for reports filed less than thirty (30) months, or
a greater length of time if so directed by the Department, from the date such increases were first required. Such costs
will be subdivided into the component parts of wages, benefits, contracted services and other costs in the amounts
equal to costs removed from the respective cost categories subject to the cap. The Department may adjust the
forecasted rate to include the projected per diem related to such costs. (3-19-07)
a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that
these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. (3-19-07)
b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule change, the costs from
each event are to be reported separately. (3-19-07)
c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a
supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department states otherwise. (3-19-07)
d. For interim rate purposes the provider's prospective rate may be granted an increase to cover such
cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may be required with the justification for the increased
costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be determined at audit and may be retrospectively settled.
 (3-19-07)
e. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods
beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were first required, the Department will, at it's option, include all
of the previously excluded costs related to those increases with costs subject to the cap when setting rates or increase
the cap and individual facility prospective rates following such cost increases. If a cap is set with these particular
costs included in the cap category, providers subject to that cap will not have these costs excluded from the cap for
prospective rate purposes. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cap until these costs are able
to be fully and equitably incorporated in the data base used to project the cap and for these costs to be exempt only
when they are not included in the data base. In those cases, when costs are not incurred immediately after a change in
rule or law, delays in incorporating the new costs in the cap are warranted. (3-19-07)
f. When cost increases which have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation
indices used to set the cap, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount is
included in the index is identified. When the cap is set to include previously excluded amounts, any adjustments
previously made to the indexes related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. (3-19-07)
02. Excess Inflation. Reimbursement of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the
Department determines the inflation indices used to set the prospective rates for a reporting period understated actual
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 629 Page 157
inflation by more than seven (7%) percentage points. In such case, prospective rates and the cap will be increased by
the amount which actual inflation indices exceeded projected inflation indices and may be retrospectively adjusted by
the department. (3-19-07)
03. Cost Increases Greater Than Three Percent. When cost increases of greater than three percent
(3%) of the projected interim rate which result from disasters such as fire, flood, or earthquake, epidemic or similar
unusual and unpredictable circumstances over which a provider has no control. Prospective rates will be increased
and they will not be subject to the cap. However, they may be retrospectively adjusted by the Department. For the
purposes of this Subsection, disaster does not include personal or financial problems. (3-19-07)
04. Decreases. In the event of state or federal law, rule, or policy changes which result in clearly
identifiable reductions in required services, the Department may reduce the prospective rate to reflect the identified
per diem amount related to such reductions. (3-19-07)
05. Prospective Negotiated Rates. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 622 of these rules, the
Director will have the authority to negotiate prospective rates for providers who would otherwise be subject to accept
retrospective settlement. Such rates will not exceed the projected allowable rate that would otherwise be reimbursed
based on provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07)
629. ICF/ID: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.
Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the
following: (3-19-07)
01. In General. Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an
audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or litigation costs incurred by the provider in an action
unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfare, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs
of which the Medicaid Program will reimburse a portion according to the percentage of Medicaid patient days.
 (3-19-07)
02. Administrative Appeals. In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appeal the
findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider’s legal counsel will
be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that the provider prevails on the issues involved. The
determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit
period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing
officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07)
03. Other. All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in actions against the Department of
Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where
specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07)
630. ICF/ID: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT.
ICFs/ID will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes, property insurance, and depreciation expense or major
moveable equipment will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate does not include
compensation for minor movable equipment. The property rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization,
depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. See Sections 56-108 and 56-109,
Idaho Code, for further clarification. (3-19-07)
01. Property Rental Rate. The property rental rate is based upon current construction costs, the age of
the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property
costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to the
following: (3-19-07)
a. R = “Property Base” x 40 - “Age” / 40 x “change in building costs” where: (3-19-07)
b. “R” = the property rental rate. (3-19-07)
c. “Property Base” = eleven dollars and twenty-two cents ($11.22) except for ICF/ID living units not
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 630 Page 158
able to accommodate residents requiring wheelchairs beginning October 1, 1996. Property base = seven dollars and
twenty-two cents ($7.22) for ICF/ID living units not able to accommodate residents requiring wheelchairs. (3-19-07)
d. “Change in building costs” = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. For ICF/ID
facilities, the most recent index available when it is first necessary to set a prospective rate for a period that includes
all or part of the calendar year, will be used. (3-19-07)
e. “Age” of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in
which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from the year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or
portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30) years, however: (3-19-07)
i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to document that the facility, or portion
thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set at thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include,
but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building permits, tax assessors' records, receipts, invoices, building
contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be determined for each building. A weighted average using
the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of each building will
be based upon the date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be adjusted to reflect major
building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large enough to reduce the age of the
facility by two (2) or more years according to the following formula:
Where:
If the result of this calculation, “r” is equal to or greater than two point zero (2.0), the age of the building in
years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will
the age be less than zero (0). (3-19-07)
ii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the
cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation of a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the
change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the formula in Subsection 630.01.d.i. However, such change
will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the point where the increase in the property rental rate is
greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate “r” for a new facility at the time of
the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before the
adjustment. The cost used for “C” will be adjusted according to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service
to reflect current construction costs for average Class D convalescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to
notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation of costs.
 (3-19-07)
iii. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will
reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requirements as an increase in the property rental rate if the
expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one
hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twelve (12) months of verification of expenditure,
reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new requirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility.
 (3-19-07)
iv. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility be less than the greater of the rate allowable
r = A x E / S x C
r = Reduction in the age of the facility in years.
A = Age of the building at the time when construction was completed.
E = Actual expenses for the construction provided that the total costs must have been
incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of the construction.
S = The number of square feet in the building at the end of construction.
C = The cost of construction for the buildings in the year when construction was
completed according to the schedule in Subsection 630.01.d.ii.
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 631 Page 159
to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immediately following the first opening of a new facility
after December 31, 1988, or the rate allowable immediately following the last, if any, age revision after December 31,
1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made
for current or successor operators, the final settlement amount of any increase in the property rental rate will first be
offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the
provisions of Subsections 630.01.d.iii. and 630.01.d.iv. of these rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow
the postponement of the financial burden to providers of property rental rate decreases and to allow an equal offset of
the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate increases for a current or successor provider. (3-19-07)
v. Effective October 1, 1996, for ICF/ID facilities, “age of facility” will be a revised age which is the
lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Section or the age which most closely yields the rate
allowable to existing facilities as of September 30, 1996, under Subsection 630.01 of these rules. This revised age
will not increase over time. (3-19-07)
02. Sale of a Facility. In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facility, the buyer will receive
the property rental rate of Subsection 630.01 of these rules. (3-19-07)
631. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATIONS.
Beginning October 1, 1996, property costs of an ICF/ID will be reimbursed in accordance with Section 630 of these
rules except as follows: (3-19-07)
01. Restrictions. No grandfathered rates or lease provisions other than lease provisions in Section 630
of these rules will apply to ICF/ID facilities. (3-19-07)
02. Home Office and Day Treatment Property Costs. Distinct parts of buildings containing ICF/ID
living units may be used for home office or day treatment purposes. Reimbursement for the property costs of such
distinct parts may be allowed if these areas are used exclusively for home office or day treatment services. The
portion of property cost attributed to these areas may be reimbursed as part of home office or day treatment costs
without a reduction in the property rental rate. Reimbursement for home office and day treatment property costs will
not include costs reimbursed by, or covered by the property rental rate. Such costs will only be reimbursed as property
cost if the facility clearly included space in excess of space normally used in such facilities. At a minimum to qualify
for such reimbursement, a structure would have square feet per licensed bed in excess of the average square feet per
licensed bed for other ICF/ID living units within four (4) licensable beds. (3-19-07)
03. Leases for Property. Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID facilities with leases will be reimbursed
as follows: (3-19-07)
a. The property costs related to ICF/ID living units other than costs for major movable equipment will
be paid by a property rental rate in accordance with Section 630 of these rules. (3-19-07)
b. Leases for property other than ICF/ID living units will be allowable based on lease cost to the
facility not to exceed a reasonable market rate, subject to other provisions of this chapter, and PRM principles
including principles associated with related party leases. (3-19-07)
632. ICF/ID: SPECIAL RATES.
Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides that the Department may pay facilities a special rate for care given to
consumers who have medical or behavior long-term care needs beyond the normal scope of facility services. These
individuals must have one (1) or more of the following behavior needs; additional personnel for supervision,
additional behavior management, or additional psychiatric or pharmacology services. A special rate may also be
given to consumers having medical needs that may include but are not limited to individuals needing ventilator
assistance, certain medical pediatric needs, or individuals requiring nasogastric or intravenous feeding devices. These
medical and behavior needs are not adequately reflected in the rates calculated pursuant to the principles set in
Section 56-265, Idaho Code. The payment for such specialized care will be in addition to any payments made in
accordance with other provisions of this chapter and will be based on a per diem rate applicable to the incremental
additional costs incurred by the facility. Payment for special rates will start with approval by the Department and be
and reviewed at least yearly for continued need. The incremental cost to a facility that exceeds the rate for services
provided pursuant to the provisions of Section 632 of these rules, will be excluded from the computation of payments
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 633 Page 160
or rates under other provisions of Section 56-265, Idaho Code, IDAPA 16.03.09, “Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits,” and
IDAPA 16.03.10, “Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits.” (3-19-07)
01. Determinations. A determination to approve or not approve a special rate will be made on a
consumer-by-consumer basis. No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is available from a nonMedicaid source. (3-19-07)
02. Approval. Special rates will not be paid unless prior authorized by the Department. A special rate
may be used in the following circumstances: (3-19-07)
a. New admissions to a community ICF/ID; (3-19-07)
b. For individuals currently living in a community ICF/ID when there has been a significant change in
condition not reflected in the current rate; or (3-19-07)
c. The facility has altered services to achieve and maintain compliance with state licensing or federal
certification requirements that have resulted in additional cost to the facility not reflected in their current rate.
 (3-19-07)
d. For the purpose of this rule, an emergency exists when the facility must incur additional behavioral
or medical costs to prevent a more restrictive placement. (3-19-07)
03. Reporting. Costs equivalent to payments at the special rate will be removed from the cost
components subject to limits, and will be reported separately. (3-19-07)
04. Limitations. The reimbursement rate paid will not exceed the provider's charges to other
participants for similar services. (3-19-07)
633. REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS FOR STATE OWNED OR OPERATED ICF/ID FACILITIES.
Provisions of these rules do not apply to ICF/ID facilities owned or operated by the state of Idaho. Reimbursement of
such facilities will be governed by the principles set forth in the PRM, with the exception of depreciation. Assets of
such facilities need not be depreciated if they have an acquisition or historical cost of less than five thousand dollars
($5,000). (3-19-07)
634. -- 648. (RESERVED)
649. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY.
The Department will pay for developmental therapy provided by facilities that have entered into a provider agreement
with the Department and are certified as developmental disabilities agencies by the Department. (7-1-13)
650. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY: ELIGIBILITY.
Prior to receiving developmental therapy in a DDA an individual must be determined by the Department or its
contractor to have a developmental disability under Sections 500 through 506 of these rules and Section 66-402,
Idaho Code be eighteen (18) years of age or older, and live in the community. (7-1-13)
651. DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPY: COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS.
Developmental therapy must be recommended by a physician or other practitioner of the healing arts. (7-1-13)
01. Requirements to Deliver Developmental Therapy. Developmental therapy may be delivered in a
developmental disabilities agency center-based program, the community, or the home of the participant. Participants
living in a certified family home must not receive home-based developmental therapy in a certified family home.
Developmental therapy includes individual developmental therapy and group developmental therapy. Developmental
therapy must be delivered by Developmental Specialists or paraprofessionals qualified in accordance with these
rules, based on an assessment completed prior to the delivery of developmental therapy. (7-1-13)

participants. As the number and severity of the participants with functional impairments or behavioral issues
IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10
Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits
Section 683 Page 179
increases, the staff participant ratio must be adjusted accordingly. (7-1-11)
