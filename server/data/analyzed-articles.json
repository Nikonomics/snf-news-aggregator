      "financialImpact": "Direct financial impact is likely minimal in the short term, but potential telehealth restrictions could increase physician visit costs by $50-150 per consultation if in-person visits are required instead of remote consultations. For a 100-bed facility using telehealth for 20-30 consultations monthly, this could translate to $1,000-4,500 in additional monthly costs. Survey delays may provide temporary relief from preparation costs but could create clustered survey activities post-shutdown. No significant one-time costs expected, but operational inefficiencies may accumulate over extended shutdown periods.",

Historical government shutdowns have shown that seemingly minor disruptions can compound into significant operational challenges, making proactive planning essential for maintaining both compliance and financial stability."
