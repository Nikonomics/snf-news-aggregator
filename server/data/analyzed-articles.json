      "financialImpact": "For a 100-bed facility operating on 1-2% margins: Initial technology investment ranges $50,000-$200,000 ($1.37-$5.48 per patient per day in year 1), with ongoing costs of $20,000-$50,000 annually ($0.55-$1.37 PPPD). However, ROI potential is significant - preventing just one major citation ($50,000+ penalty) or reducing staff turnover by 10% (saving $30,000-$50,000 annually) can justify investment. Technology-driven efficiency gains in documentation, scheduling, and compliance monitoring can reduce administrative costs by 15-25%, potentially adding 0.5-1% to operating margins within 12-18 months.",
