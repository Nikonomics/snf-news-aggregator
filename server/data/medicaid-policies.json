The tab labeled “Summary” presents summary data for each state in each of the categories. The data in the summary tab are linked to state-specific tabs that present a more detailed picture of each state’s payment policies.\n\nState policies are dynamic. If you would like to clarify or update the data presented here, please send a brief explanation and contact information to comments@macpac.gov."

In some cases, state officials were contacted for further information. Specific sources are provided in individual state tabs.\n\nThe compendium does not include dollar figures for payment rates. It does not include Medicaid programs in the U.S. territories, nor does it include payments to providers in Medicaid managed care organizations. "

    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Basic payment policy approach (B): The basic approach used to pay nursing facilities describes how states account for costs and determine allowable payments to nursing facilities. States generally choose to pay using some form of a per diem, which is a daily rate calculation. "
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Underlying basis for rates (C): States generally utilize facility costs or set a specific allowable price, which varies by type of facility, patient, or service, to determine the maximum payment to facilities."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Cost report (D): Source used to calculate the rates, which is either the Medicare cost report or a state-generated Medicaid cost report (indicated as a state report)."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Rebasing frequency (E): States update the maximum allowable payment rates periodically, which is called rebasing. Here, we compile state policies for how often rebasing is set to occur."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Inflation factor (F): Policies or indices used by states to determine how to inflate the rates paid to nursing facilities when rebasing. Due to a consolidation of companies over the past several years, states which indicated that they used Data Resources Inc. (DRI), Global Insight, or IHS Markit are listed as Economics and Country Risk, which is the business unit that conducts economic forecasting for IHS Markit and is also used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to estimate inflation."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Outlier payments (G): Unique payment policies for nursing facilities caring for patients who have a combination of extraordinary or exceptional medical, behavioral or social needs and no satisfactory placement can be made within the established payment categories."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Bed-hold policy (H): Number of days Medicaid pays for reserving resident beds due to a leave of absence for a temporary hospitalization or therapeutic or personal leave."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• New nursing facility; new owner (I): How rates are calculated when a new nursing facility is constructed or when a new owner takes over a current nursing facility."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Out-of-state (J):  Payment policy for out-of-state nursing facilities. These facilities are generally paid using the policies of their state of origin (the out-of-state rate) or the policies of the state from which they are seeking payment (the in-state rate). "

    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Other costs (O): Includes pass-through payments and other costs allocated to the Medicaid program that are fully reimbursed without limitation such as the Medicaid share of provider taxes and sometimes the Medicaid share of property taxes."
    },
    {
      "__EMPTY": "• Occupancy rate minimum (P): Many states set a minimum percentage of occupied beds per facility at which payment will be based for one or more cost centers.

These ancillary rates are reviewed and audited by the Department and, together with the routine service per diem, form an all-inclusive rate. The routine service per diem shall be based on Medicare principles of reimbursement. Ancillary services for all other facilities are reimbursed separately on a fee for service basis as defined in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), except for facilities providing subacute and pediatric subacute care. \nG.

Effective August 1, 2005, a FS/NF-B's actual reimbursement rate (per diem payment) is the amount the Department will reimburse to a FS/NF-B for services rendered to an eligible resident for one resident day.

An estimated building value will be determined based on a standard facility size of 400 square feet per bed, each facility's licensed beds, and the R.S. Means Building Construction Cost Data, adjusted by the location index for each locale in the State ofCalifornia.

The greater of the estimated building and equipment value or the fully depreciated building and equipment value will be determined for each facility (hereinafter, the \"current facility value\"). The fully depreciated building and equipment value is based on a 1.8 percent annual depreciation rate for a full 34 years.\niv. An estimate of land value will be added to the current facility value based on ten percent of the estimated building value as calculated in Section V.4.C.c.i. of this Supplement.\nv. A facility's fair rental value is calculated by multiplying the facility's current value plus the estimated land value, times a rental factor. The rental factor will be based on the average 20-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield for the calendar year preceding the rate year plus a two percent risk premium, subject to a floor ofseven percent and a ceiling often percent:\nvi. The facility's fair rental value is divided by the greater of actual resident days for the cost reporting period, or occupancy-adjusted resident days, based on the statewide average occupancy rate.

Providers of nursing facility care shall be reimbursed prospectively determined per diem rates based on a patient based classification system...\n2. The Delaware Medicaid Program shall reimburse qualified provides of long-term care based on the individual Medicaid recipient’s days of care multiplied by the applicable per diem for that patient’s classification less any payments made by recipients or third parties.\n\n(B) Cost center caps are used to set an upper limit on the amount a provider will be reimbursed for the costs in the secondary, support, and administrative cost centers. Initially, these caps are computed by determining the median value of the provider’s actual daily costs, then adjusting upwardly according to the particular cost center. The Secondary cost center cap is 115% of the provider group median, and Administrative costs are capped at 105% of the median. Delaware Medicaid will recalculate non-primary cost center caps every fourth\nyear. The next rebase will be for rates effective January 1, 2008 for Peer Groups A and B and October 1, 2007 for Peer Group C. In interim rate years, these cost center caps will not be recomputed. Instead, cost center caps will be adjusted by inflation factors. The inflation index provided by a recognized source will be applied to the current cap in each cost center in each provider group to establish the new cap. The actual reported costs will be compared to the cap. Facilities with costs above the cap will receive the amount of the cap.",

The Agency has engaged Navigant Consulting, Inc. to perform the study and develop the plan.\nEffective October 1, 2018 Florida Medicaid Nursing Home providers will be reimbursed through a prospective payment system. \n\n(B) (b) 1. The agency shall amend the long-term care reimbursement plan and cost reporting system to create direct care and indirect care subcomponents of the patient care component of the per diem rate. These two subcomponents together shall equal the patient care component of the per diem rate. Separate prices shall be calculated for each patient care subcomponent, initially based on the September 2016 rate setting cost reports and subsequently based on the most recently audited cost report used during a rebasing year. The direct care subcomponent of the per diem rate for any providers still being reimbursed on a cost basis shall be limited by the cost-based class ceiling, and the indirect care subcomponent may be limited by the lower of the cost-based class ceiling, the target rate class ceiling, or the individual provider target. \n\n(C) D. Transition\nBeginning October 1, 2018, the Agency shall reimburse providers the greater of their cost-based rate effective September 1, 2016, hereinafter referred to as “hold harmless rate”, or their prospective payment rate.\n1. The hold harmless rate will be the most current rate published to the Agency’s web page with a September 1, 2016 effective date on May 31, 2018.\n2. For providers with no published rate effective September 1, 2016, the hold harmless rate will be the prior provider’s most current rate published to the Agency’s web page with a September 1, 2016 effective date on May 31, 2018.\n3. New facilities that began operation after September 1, 2016 will not qualify for the transition payment and will receive their prospective payment rate.\n\n(D) C. The ceilings shall be determined prospectively and shall be effective the first day of the rate period, as described in section V.A. Ceilings shall be set at a level which the State determines to be adequate to reimburse a provider for the allowable and reasonable costs of an economically and efficiently operated facility. The statewide property ceilings shall be set as described in section V.A and V.B. The operating, direct care, and indirect care class ceilings shall be the maximum amount paid to any provider in that class as reimbursement for operating, direct care, and indirect care costs. Establishment of prospective class ceilings and an individual provider's reimbursement rate will reasonably take into account economic conditions and trends during the time periods covered by the payment rates.",

For all NFs that are not entitled to an inflation adjustment, or whose rate is limited by the rate determined by the acuity based reimbursement system, calculate by facility the annual amount associated with the inflation adjustment based on the Medicaid bed days from the latest available cost report. \n\n(B) The acuity based portion of the reimbursement system applies the average case mix of all of the patients in each provider's facility to the direct care price to arrive at an acuity adjusted direct care component for each provider. The resulting acuity adjusted direct care component will be combined with the other price components to establish the rate for that provider. The rate will be adjusted periodically when the acuity scores are compiled. The rate established will be used for all patient days billed to Medicaid for that period. After the initial phase in period there will no longer be a distinction between level A and level C acuity as the new thirty-four group RUG-III system will replace the old classification system. The standard price components for direct care, general and administrative, and capital were derived from the most current Medicare cost reports available on June 30, 2001 and inflated using from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the FY 03 rate year using DRI. A statewide standard price for the direct care component is calculated using the cost reports for all facilities and their respective case mix indices. ",

The rates remain in effect for the rate period and there is no retroactive reconciliation of rates to actual expenditures during the rate period.\nThe reimbursement rates are facility specific. Individual rates are set for each nursing facility, taking into account such factors as, individual facility costs, variations in patient case mix, geographical location, and other facility characteristics such as occupancy level.\nIllinois uses a case mix or patient need based system to establish the direct care payment rate. The direct care rate is based on a measure of a nursing facility’s patient case mix, which reflects the individual needs of patients within the facility and the actual services being provided to the patients. A quarterly MDS assessment for each Medicaid-eligible resident is used to determine the average patient need and service levels within each nursing facility. This, combined with the nursing rate in effect on 12/31/2006, provides the basis for determining the direct care reimbursement rate. The latest Inspection of Care on record with the Department has been used to establish the nursing rate in effect on 12/31/2006.\n\n(B) c) Rates and payments\n   1) Rates for long term care services shall be the sum of the reimbursable costs of capital, support, and nursing, as defined in this Part and 89 Ill. Adm. Code 147.\n   2) Additionally, for county-owned or operated nursing facilities, rates shall include allowable costs incurred in excess of the reimbursable costs defined in this Part and 89 Ill. Adm. Code 147.  Costs in excess of reimbursable costs shall be certified from the signed annual cost report submitted by the county to the Department.\n   3) Payment for long term care services is on a per diem basis.  In determining the number of days for which payment can be made, the day of admission to the facility is counted.  The day of discharge from the facility is not counted, unless it is the day of death and death occurs in the facility or a reserved bed has been authorized for that day.",

Cost Normalization\nThe per diem allowable direct care costs are normalized by dividing a facility’s per diem direct care costs by the facility’s cost report period case-mix index. The facility cost report period case-mix index is the average of quarterly facility-wide average case-mix indices, carried to four decimal places.\nThe quarters used in this average are the quarters that most closely coincide with the financial and statistical reporting period.  \nc. Calculation of Patient-Day-Weighted Medians\nA patient-day-weighted median is established for each of the non-state-owned nursing facility rate components.\nThe per diem normalized direct care cost for each non-state-owned facility is arrayed from low to high to determine the direct care component patient-day-weighted median cost based on the number of patient days provided by facilities. \nThe per diem non-direct care cost for each facility is also arrayed from low to high to determine the non-direct care component patient-day-weighted median cost based on the number of patient days provided by facilities. \n\n(B) e. Calculate Reimbursement Rate\nThe Medicaid reimbursement rate is based on allowable costs, updated July 1, 2001, and every second year thereafter and adjusted quarterly to account for changes in the provider’s Medicaid average case-mix index, plus a potential excess payment allowance and a capital cost per diem relief add-on for qualifying nursing facilities, not to exceed an overall rate component limit.",

Nursing facility payments for services provided to MassHealth members are governed by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) regulation, 101 CMR 206.00: Standard Payments to Nursing Facilities as of October 1, 2018. This attachment describes the methods and standards used to establish payment rates for nursing facilities effective October 1, 2018.\nB. Chief Components. The payment method describes standard payments for nursing facility services. Standard payments are derived from reported median base-year costs for Nursing and Other Operating Costs as well as a capital payment component. Nursing and other Operating Standard Payment rates were calculated using Calendar Year (CY) 2007 costs. The allowable basis for capital was updated using CY 2007 data.\n\n(B) (1) General.

If a provider has closed on or before November 30th, the provider is not required to file an HCF-1 report.\n(b) Realty Company Cost Report. A provider that does not own the real property of the nursing facility and pays rent to an affiliated or non-affiliated realty trust or other business entity must file or cause to be filed a Realty Company Cost Report with the Center.\n(c) Management Company Cost Report. A provider must file a separate Management Company Cost Report with the Center for each entity for which it reports management or central office expenses related to the care of Massachusetts publicly aided residents. If the provider identifies such costs, the provider must certify that costs are reasonable and necessary for the care of publicly aided residents in Massachusetts.\n(d) Financial Statements. If a provider or its parent organization is required or elects to obtain independent audited financial statements for purposes other than 101 CMR 206.00, the provider must file a complete copy of its audited financial statements with the Center, that most closely correspond to the provider’s Nursing Facility Cost Report fiscal period. If the provider or its parent organization does not obtain audited financial statements but is required or elects to obtain reviewed or compiled financial statements for purposes other than 101 CMR 206.00, the provider must file with the Center a complete copy of its financial statements that most closely correspond to the Nursing Facility Cost Report fiscal period. Financial statements must accompany the provider’s Nursing Facility Cost Report filing. Nothing in 101 CMR 206.08(1)(d) will be construed as an additional requirement that nursing homes complete audited, reviewed, or compiled financial statements solely to comply with the Center’s reporting requirements.\n(e) Clinical Data. EOHHS may require providers to submit patient level data for the purpose of measuring clinical performance in a format specified by EOHHS. EOHHS may designate required data, data specifications, and other data collection requirements by administrative bulletin.\n(f) CMS-2540 Reports. State operated nursing facilities that meet the definition in 42 CFR 433.50(a)(i) must file a CMS-2540 report with the Center annually.

Participating Medicaid providers' nursing facility resident days and cost information are reported to the SMA on an annual cost report submitted by the nursing facility. The nursing facility industry aggregate cost data is used to analyze and determine facility class reimbursement limits and related cost levels necessary for calculating nursing facility per diem rates and other analysis. The facility's routine nursing care per diem rate includes plant and variable cost based on the facility's audited allowable costs, measured against class wide rate limitations. Additional reimbursement for specific services outside of the routine nursing care per diem rate are also analyzed and determined from the facility's annual cost report and included in the Medicaid annual reimbursement settlement. \n\n10.1 RATE DETERMINATION PROCESS\nThe per diem reimbursement rate for Class I and Class III nursing facility providers is made up of three components: a plant cost component, a variable cost component, and add-ons.\n■ For Class I facilities, the plant cost component is made up of the Property Tax/Interest Expense/Lease Component plus the Return on Current Asset Value Component. \n■ For Class III facilities, the Plant Cost Component is the lesser of the Facility Per Patient Day Plant Cost or the Facility Plant Cost Limit. The Facility Plant Cost Component is the depreciation, interest and lease expenses calculated on a per patient day basis.\n■ For Class I and Class III facilities, the Variable Cost Component is made up of the facility's Variable Rate Base plus the Economic Inflationary Update.

Complex care cases are those requiring specialized care beyond services covered by the usual Medicaid per diem rate. The payment rate for specially-placed residents is a negotiated prospective rate per resident day.\nReimbursement is made for prior authorized services/care to residents who have specialized and concentrated nursing and support service needs and who have been transferred from an acute care hospital setting to an approved nursing facility. The negotiated rate provides reimbursement adequate to meet the unusual needs of this type of resident in a less costly and more appropriate environment than an acute care hospital setting.\nFactors used in Medicaid's negotiation of the per resident day prospective rate include, but are not limited to, complexity, type of equipment and supplies required, the resident's condition, and the market place availability of placement. Any authorized increase in the per diem rate represents only the cost of the service. The negotiated prospective rate is re-evaluated, in consideration of the resident's needs, prior to the last day of the approval period.\n\n(B) G. Payment Determination for Specially Placed Patients The payment rates for all specially placed patients shall be an individually negotiated per patient day prospective rate determined by the single state agency. The rate for these patients shall not be subject to the provisions in Sections IV.A. through IV.F. above, but the provisions within this section shall be used for payment determination.\n1. Payment shall be made for specially placed patients transferred from an acute-care hospital setting to an approved nursing facility on a prior authorized basis. The purpose of the negotiated rate is to provide reimbursement adequate to meet the unusual needs of this type of patient in a less costly and more appropriate environment than an inpatient hospital setting. The goal of this policy is the most cost effective provision of services needed by the special care patient.\n2. Factors used by the single state agency in the determination of the per patient day prospective rate include, but are not limited to:” complexity, type of equipment and supplies required, the patient’s condition and the market place availability of placement.

The QAAP provides a QAS payment and Quality Measure Initiative payment to nursing facilities by incorporating funds from the quality assurance assessment tax. When a provider sells a nursing facility, the provider is responsible for all QAAP assessments billed and incurred prior to the date of the sale. The purchaser(s) must assure escrow of any outstanding QAAP amounts owed, or the purchaser(s) becomes responsible for payment of the QAAP and penalty amounts owed before Medicaid participation is granted. If the provider quits the business, the provider is responsible for all QAAP assessments billed and prorated as of the date MDHHS determines the facility closed. The QAAP applies to Class I, Class III and Class V nursing facilities.\n10.7.A. QUALITY ASSURANCE SUPPLEMENT (QAS) FOR CLASS I AND CLASS III NURSING FACILITIES\nThe nursing facility will receive a QAS payment as a monthly gross adjustment. The monthly gross adjustment for an individual nursing facility will be determined based on one-twelfth of the facility's annual historical Medicaid utilization (resident days) multiplied by the facility's QAS per resident day...\nA facility's QAS is equal to the lesser of the facility's Variable Rate Base or Class Variable Cost Limit times the Quality Assurance Assessment Factor (QAAF) determined by MDHHS, except for Class III publicly owned facilities, in which the QAAF is multiplied by the lesser of the facility’s Variable Cost Component or the Class I Variable Cost Limit. A provider's QAS will be reconciled at the end of the fiscal year to accommodate the actual Medicaid utilization, changes to the variable rate from filed to audited cost report data, and to adjust the increase initially estimated to accommodate the fixed pool of funds established by the QAAP and any legislative offsets to that pool.\n10.13.F. FACILITY INNOVATIVE DESIGN SUPPLEMENTAL (FIDS) PROGRAM\nEffective for dates of service on and after October 1, 2007, Medicaid providers participating in the Facility Innovative Design Supplemental (FIDS) program are eligible to receive supplemental reimbursement for room and board services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries when the beneficiary resides in a FIDS bed. FIDS participating facilities are eligible for the reimbursement supplement for up to 20 consecutive years beginning in the fiscal year of the project completion date. ",

The lesser of the actual rate or the limit rate for Other Direct Care and Indirect Care, the Property rate and the adjustments provided for in Section 25 - Rate Limits and Incentives are then added to the Direct Care rate for each classification to arrive at the established rate for a given classification.\n\nSection 25 – Rate Limits and Incentives \n1. Limits - All facilities except those nongeriatric facilities for individuals with physical disabilities or units within a nursing facility providing geropsychicatric services described in Section 5 - Exclusions must be used to establish a limit rate for the Direct Care, Other Direct Care, and Indirect Care cost categories.

These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations taking into consideration relevant factors including resident needs, nursing hours necessary to meet resident needs, size of the nursing facility and the costs that must be incurred for the care of residents in an efficiently and economically operated nursing facility.\n\n(C) The department shall establish limits on actual allowable historical operating cost per diems based on cost reports of allowable operating costs.",

The Executive Budget proposes to update rates beginning in state fiscal year 2017 using calendar year 2013 costs as a basis. The update is required by current law and will result in rates more reflective of current health care costs and service delivery in Ohio’s nursing facilities. Rebasing also creates the opportunity to update the resource utilization group (RUGs) methodology used to measure resident acuity in the state’s nursing facilities. Ohio uses nationally recognized acuity measurement software that employs clinical data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In 2010, CMS updated the data collection tool and offered states the option of using an updated grouper. At the time, Ohio continued using the older grouper (RUGS III) because it aligned with the years-old rate components in effect, but now will update to RUGS IV to coincide with the calculation of new rate components during the rebasing process. The net impact of the effort to rebase nursing facility rates and implement a new grouper will increase nursing facility spending $84.1 million ($31.7 million state share) in 2017, all of which will be applied to a new quality improvement program, described below.\n\n(B) ...the Ohio Department of Medicaid will rebase nursing facility rates on July 1, 2016 in conjunction with implementation of the RUG IV classification system. As a result of rebasing, the Ohio Department of Medicaid estimates aggregate nursing facility per diem rates will increase by approximately $112 - $125 million in state fiscal year 2017.",

Each RUG will have a weight indicating the level of care for the resident in the nursing facility.\n\n(B) Recognition of patient acuity in the payment methodology is being incorporated through the use of a RUG-IV case-mix classification system. The case-mix classification system uses clinical data from the MDS assessment to assign a case-mix group to each patient that is then used to adjust a portion of the per diem payment based on patient resource use. (This is similar to how Medicare reimburses for care in a skilled nursing facility.) Each patient will be assigned one of forty-eight (48) RUG categories by the grouper based on his/her MDS record. A patient's MDS record is to be updated every ninety (90) days or in the event of a significant change in condition. Acuity will be based on the patient specific RUG category, i.e. full RUG-based system. The acuity factor (RUG weight) will be applied only to the Direct Nursing Care component. To allow for necessary modifications to the state's MMIS claims processing system, full implementation of the RUG-based process will be implemented on June 1, 2013.

General Services: \na. Accumulate all allowable cost for the General Services cost center (Nursing & Restorative) for all facilities in each bed size. \nb.

The establishment of the General Services standard for all nursing facilities (excluding state owned facilities) will be based on the average of the percentage of Medicaid Level A patients/total Medicaid patients served. Rates effective on or after October 1, 2000 will be computed annually using nursing facility utilization (including nursing facility days paid under the Hospice Benefit) by patient acuity based upon the preceding July 1 through June 30 data period. Effective October 1, 2003, co-insurance days for dual eligibles are excluded from the computation. Effective December 31, 2011, nursing facility providers will no longer be allowed to appeal its acuity level (i.e. percent skilled) payment adjustment determination for any current or future year payment rates. The General Services standard for each separate facility will be determined in relation to the percent of Level A Medicaid patients served, i.e., the base standard determination in (d.) above will be decreased as the percent of Level A Medicaid patients is decreased and increased as the percent of Level A Medicaid patients is increased.\n\n1. For each facility, determine allowable cost for the following categories:\nCOST SUBJECT TO STANDARDS: General Services; Dietary; Laundry, Maintenance and Housekeeping; Administration and Medical Records & Services\nCOST NOT SUBJECT TO STANDARDS: Utilities; Special Services; Medical Supplies; Property Taxes and Insurance Coverage - Building and Equipment; Legal Fees\n2. Calculate actual allowable cost per day based on the cost reports for each category by dividing allowable cost by actual days.\n3.

All other cost center standards will be computed using private for profit free standing nursing facilities. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON THE CALCULATION OF ALL THE STANDARDS IS AS FOLLOWS: \n1. General Services: \na. Accumulate all allowable cost for the General Services cost center (Nursing & Restorative) for all facilities in each bed size. \nb. Determine total patient days by multiplying total beds for all facilities in each group by (366 x 90%). \nc. Calculate the mean cost per patient day by dividing total cost in (a) by total patient days in (b). \nd. Calculate the standard by multiplying the mean by 105%. \ne. The establishment of the General Services standard for all nursing facilities (excluding state owned facilities) will be based on the average of the percentage of Medicaid Level A patients/total Medicaid patients served. Rates effective on or after October 1, 2000 will be computed annually using nursing facility utilization (including nursing facility days paid under the Hospice Benefit) by patient acuity based upon the preceding July 1 through June 30 data period. Effective October 1, 2003, co-insurance days for dual eligibles are excluded from the computation. Effective December 31, 2011, nursing facility providers will no longer be allowed to appeal its acuity level (i.e. percent skilled) payment adjustment determination for any current or future year payment rates. The General Services standard for each separate facility will be determined in relation to the percent of Level A Medicaid patients served, i.e., the base standard determination in (d.) above will be decreased as the percent of Level A Medicaid patients is decreased and increased as the percent of Level A Medicaid patients is increased.\n\n1. For each facility, determine allowable cost for the following categories:\nCOST SUBJECT TO STANDARDS: General Services; Dietary; Laundry, Maintenance and Housekeeping; Administration and Medical Records & Services\nCOST NOT SUBJECT TO STANDARDS: Utilities; Special Services; Medical Supplies; Property Taxes and Insurance Coverage - Building and Equipment; Legal Fees\n2. Calculate actual allowable cost per day based on the cost reports for each category by dividing allowable cost by actual days.\n3. For costs not subject to standards, the cost determined in step 2 will be allowed in determining the facility's rate.\n4. For costs not subject to standards, the cost determined in step 2 will be allowed in determining the facility's rate. ",

Effective FYE 9/30/2019, nursing facilities filing this cost report will have the option to use the HFS MCRIF32 2540-10 with the PIRS 1090 incorporated into it and submit the HFS data files (MCRX) in lieu of the PIRS 1090 Excel forms. HFS will provide this option to clients at no additional fee.\nAt the same time, DMAS will continue to offer the option of submitting the traditional Excel PIRS 1090 cost report. If nursing facilities choose this option, they must also submit the electronic cost report files (SN & PI). Regardless of the option chosen, all Phase 1 submissions must be made through eDocMgmt. The target date for the release of the VACRS Phase 1 is December 1, 2019. At that time, the new cost report software will be made available on the DMAS website for download by nursing facilities. In addition, HFS will contact nursing facilities participating in VA Medicaid to offer a WebEx training on the new cost report software.",

The capital rate is set using a fair market rental system. The quality enhancement is set using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality data. A facility's Medicaid rate is a total of four component rates: 1) direct care (DC), 2) indirect care (lDC) 3) capital (C), and 4) quality enhancement (QE).\n\nMedicaid rates are subject to a \"budget dial\", under which the State is required to reduce rates for all participating nursing facilities statewide by a uniform percentage, after notice and on a prospective basis only, if the statewide average facility total rate, weighted by Medicaid resident days, approaches an overall limit for a particular state fiscal year. Under RCW 74.46.421, the statewide average payment rate for any state fiscal year (SFY) weighted by patient days shall not exceed the statewide weighted average nursing facility payment rate identified for that SFY in the biennial appropriations act (budgeted rate). After the State determines all nursing facility payment rates in accordance with chapter 74.46 RCW and chapter 388-96 WAC, it determines whether the weighted average nursing facility payment rate is equal to or likely to exceed the budgeted rate for the applicable SFY. lf the weighted average nursing facility payment rate is equal to or likely to exceed the budgeted rate, then the State adjusts all nursing facility payment rates proportional to the amount by which the weighted average rate allocations would exceed the budgeted rate. Adjustments for the current SFY are made prospectively, not retrospectively and applied proportionately to each nursing facility's component rate allocation. The application of RCW 74.46.421 is termed applying the \"budget dial\". The budget dial supersedes all rate setting principles in chapteÍs 74.46 RCW and 388-96 WAC. For SFY 2019 (July 3, 2018, through June 30,2019), the budget dial rate is $ 216.64.",

In applying case mix principles for direct care rate setting, data is taken from facility-completed, mandatory assessments of individual residents, and using a software program that groups residents by care needs, the State determines for each facility both a facility average case mix index (for all the facility's residents) and a Medicaid average case mix index (for Medicaid residents only)... Also, when establishing direct care component rates, the State will use an average of facility case mix indexes from the four calendar quarters occurring during the cost report period used to rebase the direct care component rate allocations.\nIn determining case mix weights, the State will assign the lowest case mix weight to the resource utilization group III classification group with the lowest total weighted minutes and calculate case mix weights by dividing the lowest group’s total weighted minutes into each group’s total weighted minutes and rounding weight calculations to the third decimal place. Each facility's allowable direct care cost per resident day is divided by the facility's average case mix index to derive the facility's allowable direct care cost per case mix unit. \nDirect care is paid at a fixed rate based on one hundred percent or greater of statewide case mix neutral median costs. Direct care is performance adjusted for acuity using case mix principles. It is then regionally adjusted using county wide wage index information available through the United States Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nDirect care includes routine therapy which is the average one-on-one care from qualified therapists delivered to a Medicaid resident during one day, and the average therapy consultation from qualified consultants delivered to a resident during one day. Four types of therapy are recognized for rate setting: speech, physical, occupational, and other. Two general service categories are recognized for each: one-on-one therapy and therapy consulting. These do not include rehabilitative therapies. \nTo determine allowable routine therapy costs, the department takes from cost reports direct one-on-one therapy charges for all residents by payer, including costs of supplies, and total units or modules of therapy care, for all residents from the report period by type of therapy provided. The department also takes from cost reports therapy consulting expenses for all residents by type of therapy.\nThe department determines the total one-on-one cost for each type of therapy care at each participating nursing facility, and divides by the facility's total units of therapy for each therapy type, to derive the per unit one-on-one cost for each type. A unit or module of therapy care is defined as fifteen minutes of one-on-one therapy.\nThe department determines total therapy consulting for each type of therapy at each nursing facility, and divides by the facility's resident days to derive per resident day consulting cost for each type of therapy. Each facility's allowable cost in each of the four therapy types is then multiplied by the units provided by the facility for the applicable year by type. The result is multiplied by the Medicaid percentage of charges for each category, and divided by adjusted Medicaid resident days from the report period, to derive the Medicaid resident day allowable one-on-one cost for each therapy type.\nThe facility's allowable Medicaid resident day one-on-one cost and its allowable resident day consulting cost are each multiplied by the facility's total adjusted resident days to calculate its total allowable one-on-one therapy expense and total allowable consulting therapy expense.

For example, the 2015 cost report is used for July 1, 2016, rate setting, and the 2016 cost report is used for July 1, 2017, rate setting, etc. The fair rental rate allocation for each facility is determined by multiplying the allowable nursing home square footage by the RSMeans rental rate and by the number of licensed beds yielding the gross unadjusted building value. The sum of the unadjusted building value and equipment allowance is then reduced by the average age of the facility as determined using a depreciation rate of one and one-half percent.

If necessary, the department may further adjust the amount(s) of the SNA at other times during the SFY. Although subject to change as necessary and as permitted under the act, the expectation is that each year the SNA will be imposed at two different levels: a higher level for most nonexempt facilities, and a significantly lower level for facilities that have either a high medicaid census on the prior year's cost report or a high number of licensed beds. For SFY 2012, those thresholds were thirty-two thousand medicaid resident days, and two hundred and three licensed beds. Those thresholds may change, as necessary and permitted under the act. Beginning July 1, 2012 the department will submit any adjustments to the SNA amount(s), along with the data supporting the adjustments, to the Washington health care association and the aging services of Washington for review and comment at least sixty calendar days prior to implementation of the adjusted assessment amounts. These submissions may be made electronically. If necessary to comply with the sixty-day notice requirement and still make the adjustment effective as of July 1, or another effective date, these notices may be made on a provisional, or potential, basis or bases.\n(2) The status of each nursing facility under the act will be determined based on the facility's characteristics as of July 1 of each SFY, but using the information on resident days from the prior calendar year's cost report. For example, a facility's status for the SNA for SFY 2014 (beginning July 1, 2013) would be based on the resident day information from the 2012 cost report. The status of facilities will not be altered thereafter during the SFY. Facilities that become licensed throughout the SFY will be subject to the SNA as of the date of their licensing. The office of rates management (ORM) of the aging and disability services administration (ADSA) of the department will inform each nursing facility of its status under the act.

If the former is smaller than the latter, the facility’s rate reduction may be no more than one percent on July 1, 2016, no more than two percent on July 1, 2017, and no more than five percent on July 1, 2018.

Significant renovations are renovations that exceed two thousand dollars per bed in a calendar year as reported on the annual cost report. For the rate beginning July 1, 2016 the Department will use renovation data back to 1994 as submitted on facility cost reports. Beginning July 1, 2016, facility ages are to be reduced in future years if the value of the renovation completed in any year exceeds two thousand dollars times the number of licensed beds. The cost of the renovation is divided by the accumulated depreciation per bed in the year of the renovation to determine the equivalent number of new replacement beds. The new age for the facility is a weighted average with the replacement bed equivalents reflecting an age of zero and the existing licensed beds, minus the new bed equivalents, reflecting their age in the year of the renovation. At no time may the depreciated age be less than zero or greater than forty-four years.\n\n(D) The department may grant prospective rate adjustment to fund new requirements imposed by the federal government or by the department, if the department determines a rate increase is necessary in order to implement the new requirement. Rates may be adjusted prospectively and retrospectively to correct errors or omissions on the part of the department or the facility, or to implement the final result of a provider appeal if needed, or to fund the cost of placing a nursing facility in receivership or to aid the receiver in correcting deficiencies.",

All providers have the opportunity to earn the full quality enhancement payment.

The quality enhancement component is based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) quality measures for the percentage of long-stay resdients who self-report moderate to severe pain, the percentage of high-risk long-stay residents with pressure ulcers, the percentage of long-stay residents experiencing one or more falls with major injury, and the percentage of long-stay residents with a urinary tract infection, short-stay newly administered anti-psychotic medications, and turnover or direct care staff. Quality measures are reviewed on an annual basis by a stakeholder workgroup established by the Department. The Department may risk adjust individual quality measures as it deems appropriate. The facility quality score is point based using the facility’s most recent available three-quarter average Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data. Point thresholds for each quality measure are established using the corresponding statistical values for the quality measure (QM) point determinants of eighty QM points, sixty QM points, forty QM points, and twenty QM points, as identified in the most recent available five-star quality rating system technical user’s guide published by CMS.\n\nThe tier system is used to determine the amount of each facility’s per patient day quality enhancement component.

The per patient day quality enhancement component for Tier III is fifty percent of the per patient day quality enhancement component for Tier V. The per patient day quality enhancement component for Tier II is twenty-five percent of the per patient day quality enhancement component for Tier V. Facilities in Tier I receive no quality enhancement payment. Facilities with insufficient three-quarter average CMS quality data must be assigned to the tier corresponding to their five-star quality rating. For example, a facility with a five-star quality rating would be assigned to Tier V while a facility with a one-star quality rating would be assigned to Tier I.

This allowance is intended to provide payment for ownership and/or rental of land, land improvements, buildings, fixed and movable equipment and any other long-term, physical assets. \nAnnualized allowable property expenses will be limited to 15% of the equalized value of the facility. \nThe property target is 7.5% of equalized value. \nWhen the facility's allowable property-related expenses are greater than the target, the property payment allowance will be the target amount plus the cost share value (20% or 40%) times the amount by which allowable expenses exceed the target. \nNursing facilities licensed as NF only that have beds for rate setting of 50 beds or less will have a cost share value of 40%.

The values established by such contract will be indexed, if necessary, to the current rate year. The equalized value will be the Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) from the BVS valuation after adjustment for square footage allocations and the per bed maximum on equalized value.\nThe values derived from the BVS valuation will be adjusted to exclude the value of areas not related to skilled nursing facility patient care. To the extent possible, this adjustment will be based on the square footage used in the BVS valuation.\nThe Undepreciated Replacement Cost (URC) arrived at under the BVS valuation will be limited to not exceed $75,900 times the beds for rate setting.

The incentive is equal to 50% of the acquisition cost per day. \n6.60 Behavioral/Cognitive Impairment (Beh/CI) Incentives\nThe Behavioral/Cognitive Impairment Incentives (Beh/CI) provides additional reimbursement for costs associated with the care of patients with specific behavioral or cognitive difficulties. The incentives are calculated by applying two scores for each resident, an Access Score and an Improvement score. The score values are defined by the MDS elements listed below and acuity categories ranging from 0 to 5 based on psychiatric and related diagnosis codes under the International Classification of Diseases, as organized via decision rules promulgated under the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS). The Beh/CI scores are based on index values aggregated at the facility level, calculated using data from Title 19 FFS Non-DD residents present on the last day of the second quarter of the fiscal year that also had a RUGable MDS assessment on or prior to that date. The scores are only calculated for individuals when they have both a RUGable MDS assessment and a CDPS score greater than zero. \n6.70 Medicaid Access Incentive (MAI)\nThe Medicaid access incentive is provided to all facilities to facilitate access to nursing facility care for Medicaid recipients. Facilities certified as a nursing facility will receive an incentive of $9.65.  ",
