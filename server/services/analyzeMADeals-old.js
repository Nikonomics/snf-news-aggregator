  "states": ["PA", "OH"],
  "acquirerType": "Private Equity",
  "sellerType": "Individual Owner",
  "strategicRationale": "This deal signals PE firms targeting distressed SNF assets in Medicaid-heavy markets. The acquirer gains regional density in Pennsylvania's competitive post-acute market. This follows a pattern of consolidation in the Midwest where operators with scale can better negotiate with managed care payers.",
