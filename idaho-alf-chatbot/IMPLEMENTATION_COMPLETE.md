available during residents' sleeping hours [1.01].

enough personnel to provide care and supervision as required in 
each resident's Negotiated Service Agreement (NSA) [1.04.a-b].

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes** (`backend/rag_engine.py`)

1. **Updated System Prompt**
   ```python
   CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST use inline citations [1], [2], [3], etc. 
   throughout your response.
   
   Rules:
   - Every statement about a regulation MUST include an inline citation
   - Use the citation number that corresponds to the regulation
   - Example: "According to [1], facilities must maintain..."
   ```

2. **Numbered Context**
   ```python
   context = "\n\n".join([
       f"[{i+1}] **{chunk['citation']} - {chunk['section_title']}**\n{chunk['content'][:2000]}..."
       for i, chunk in enumerate(retrieved_chunks)
   ])
   ```

3. **Reminder at End of Prompt**
   ```python
   REMINDER: Use inline citations [1], [2], [3], etc. in your answer. 
   Every statement about a regulation must include a citation number.
   ```

### **Frontend Changes** (`src/components/IdahoALFChatbot.jsx`)

1. **Clickable Citation Badges**
   ```jsx
   <button
     onClick={() => {
       if (fullRegulation) {
         setSelectedRegulation(fullRegulation);
       }
     }}
     className="bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-100 cursor-pointer"
   >
     [{idx + 1}] {citation.citation}
   </button>
   ```

2. **Inline Citation Rendering**
   ```jsx
   <ReactMarkdown
     components={{
       text: ({node, ...props}) => {
         // Detect citation patterns [1], [2], etc.
         // Convert to clickable buttons
         // Match to regulation content
       }
     }}
   >
     {message.content}
   </ReactMarkdown>
   ```
