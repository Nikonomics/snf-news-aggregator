# RAG Process Explained - Idaho ALF Chatbot

## 🔍 What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique that combines:
1. **Vector Search** - Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
2. **LLM Generation** - Using AI to generate natural language answers

This gives you accurate, cited answers instead of the AI making things up!

---

## 📊 Current RAG Process (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: User Asks a Question**
```
"What are the staffing requirements for a 20-bed facility?"
```

### **Step 2: Generate Query Embedding**
- Convert the question into a vector (list of numbers)
- Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model
- Example: `[0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]` (1536 dimensions)

### **Step 3: Retrieve Relevant Chunks**
- Compare query embedding with all 225 regulation chunks
- Calculate **cosine similarity** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Sort by similarity (highest first)
- Select top K chunks

**Current Settings:**
- `top_k = 5` ⚠️ **TOO LOW**
- `similarity_threshold = 0.3` ⚠️ **TOO HIGH**
- No diversity filtering ⚠️ **MIGHT GET DUPLICATES**

### **Step 4: Build Prompt**
- Combine retrieved chunks into a prompt
- Include system instructions
- Add conversation history

**Current Settings:**
- `max_content_length = 1000` ⚠️ **TOO SHORT** (loses important details)
- `temperature = 0.3` ⚠️ **TOO LOW** (too rigid)
- `maxTokens = 2048` ⚠️ **TOO LOW** (might truncate)

### **Step 5: Generate Answer**
- Send prompt to Claude/GPT-4
- AI reads the context and generates answer
- Returns answer with citations

## 🐛 **Problems Identified**

### **Problem 1: Insufficient Context**
```
Current: top_k = 5 chunks
Problem: Only 5 chunks might not have enough information
Impact: Answers are incomplete or miss important details
```

**Example:**
- Question: "What are the staffing requirements?"
- Only retrieves 1 chunk about staffing (similarity 0.58)
- Misses related chunks about training, orientation, etc.

### **Problem 2: Content Truncation**
```
Current: max_content_length = 1000 chars per chunk
Problem: Long regulations get cut off
Impact: Missing important details in the answer
```

**Example:**
- IDAPA 16.03.22.250 is 11,481 characters
- Only 1000 characters included in prompt
- Missing 91% of the content!

### **Problem 3: Low Similarity Scores**
```
Current: Most chunks have 0.40-0.42 similarity
Problem: Not high enough for confident answers
Impact: Retrieved chunks might not be very relevant
```

**Diagnostic Results:**
- Best match: 0.5862 (Good, not Excellent)
- Most matches: 0.40-0.42 (Fair)
- With threshold 0.5: Only 1 chunk retrieved
- With threshold 0.7: 0 chunks retrieved

### **Problem 4: No Diversity**
```
Current: No diversity filtering
Problem: Might retrieve very similar chunks
Impact: Redundant information, missing different perspectives
```

### **Problem 5: Too Deterministic**
```
Current: temperature = 0.3
Problem: Very rigid, formulaic responses
Impact: Answers sound robotic, not natural
```

## ✅ **Solutions & Improvements**

### **Solution 1: Increase Context**
```python
# OLD
top_k = 5

# NEW
top_k = 12  # or 15 for complex questions
```
**Benefit:** More comprehensive answers with better coverage

### **Solution 2: Lower Similarity Threshold**
```python
# OLD
similarity_threshold = 0.3

# NEW
similarity_threshold = 0.0  # Get all relevant chunks, let diversity filter handle it
```
**Benefit:** Don't miss potentially relevant chunks

### **Solution 3: Increase Content Length**
```python
# OLD
max_content_length = 1000

# NEW
max_content_length = 2000  # or even 3000
```
**Benefit:** Include more details from long regulations

### **Solution 4: Add Diversity Filtering**
```python
# NEW
diversity_threshold = 0.05  # Chunks must be at least 5% different
```
**Benefit:** Avoid redundant information, get diverse perspectives

### **Solution 5: Increase Temperature**
```python
# OLD
temperature = 0.3

# NEW
temperature = 0.5  # or 0.6 for more natural responses
```
**Benefit:** More natural, conversational answers

### **Solution 6: Increase Max Tokens**
```python
# OLD
maxTokens = 2048

# NEW
maxTokens = 3000  # or 4000 for detailed answers
```
**Benefit:** Don't truncate long, detailed answers

## 🚀 **Recommended Settings**

### **For Simple Questions**
```python
{
    "top_k": 8,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.0,
    "max_content_length": 1500,
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "maxTokens": 2500
}
```

### **For Complex Questions**
```python
{
    "top_k": 15,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.0,
    "max_content_length": 2000,
    "temperature": 0.6,
    "maxTokens": 4000
}
```

### **For Quick Answers**
```python
{
    "top_k": 5,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.0,
    "max_content_length": 1000,
    "temperature": 0.4,
    "maxTokens": 1500
}
```

## 📈 **Expected Improvements**

### **Before (Current Settings)**
- Retrieves 5 chunks
- 1000 chars per chunk
- Similarity scores: 0.40-0.42 (Fair)
- Temperature: 0.3 (rigid)
- **Result:** Incomplete, formulaic answers

### **After (Improved Settings)**
- Retrieves 12 chunks
- 2000 chars per chunk
- Similarity scores: 0.40-0.58 (Good)
- Temperature: 0.5 (natural)
- **Result:** Comprehensive, natural answers

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **1. Run Diagnostic**
```bash
cd backend
python3 diagnose_rag.py
```
This shows what chunks are being retrieved and their similarity scores.

### **2. Test Improved RAG**
```bash
cd backend
python3 rag_engine_improved.py
```
This tests the improved settings with sample questions.

### **3. Compare Results**
Try the same question with both engines and compare:
- Number of chunks retrieved
- Similarity scores
- Quality of answers
- Completeness of information

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Options**

### **Option 1: Update Main RAG Engine (Recommended)**
Update `rag_engine.py` with improved defaults:
```python
def answer_question(
    self,
    question: str,
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Dict]] = None,
    top_k: int = 12,  # Changed from 5
    similarity_threshold: float = 0.0,  # Changed from 0.3
    temperature: float = 0.5,  # Changed from 0.3
    verbose: bool = False
):
```

### **Option 2: Use Improved RAG Engine**
Replace `rag_engine.py` with `rag_engine_improved.py`:
```bash
mv rag_engine.py rag_engine_old.py
mv rag_engine_improved.py rag_engine.py
```

### **Option 3: Make Settings Configurable**
Add a config file to adjust settings without code changes:
```python
# config.json
{
    "top_k": 12,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.0,
    "max_content_length": 2000,
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "maxTokens": 3000
}
```

## 📊 **Monitoring & Optimization**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
1. **Average Similarity Score** - Should be > 0.5 for good results
2. **Number of Chunks Retrieved** - Should match top_k setting
3. **Response Length** - Should be comprehensive but not too long
4. **User Satisfaction** - Are answers helpful?

### **When to Adjust Settings**
- **Increase top_k** if answers are incomplete
- **Decrease top_k** if answers are too long or confusing
- **Increase temperature** if answers sound robotic
- **Decrease temperature** if answers are too creative
- **Increase max_content_length** if missing important details
- **Add diversity filtering** if getting redundant information
