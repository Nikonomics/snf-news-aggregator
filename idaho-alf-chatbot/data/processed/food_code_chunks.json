    "content": "INTRODUCTION to the 2013 FOOD CODE\nThe federal government is committed to enhanced coordination with state, local, and tribal agencies,\nand the food industry to protect our food supply, and the Food Code is one important element in this\nstrategy. HHS and USDA will continue to take progressive steps to partner with all who have a stake\nin food safety, and are committed to reducing the incidence of foodbome illness in the United States.\nThis edition of the Food Code reflects our current understanding of evidenced-based practices for the\neffective control of microbiological, chemical and physical hazards in food facilities that can cause\nfoodbome illness. Many of the changes to this edition reflect recommendations made at the 2012\nbiennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection, a national organization that affords scientists\nand policy makers from all levels of government, industry, academia and consumers the opportunity to\npropose and deliberate on improvements to the Food Code.\nAs of 2012, all 50 states and 3 of 6 territories report having retail codes patterned after previous\neditions of the Food Code. We strongly encourage the adoption and implementation of the 2013 Food\nCode at all levels of government.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food Safety and Inspection\nService of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are pleased to announce the release of the 2013\nand eighth edition of the Food Code. The Food Code is a model code and reference document for\nstate, city, county and tribal agencies that regulate operations such as restaurants, retail food stores,\nfood vendors, and foodservice operations in institutions such as schools, hospitals, assisted living,\nnursing homes and child care centers. Food safety practices at these facilities play a critical role in\npreventing foodbome illness. The Food Code establishes practical, scien",

The reported case\nfatality rate is 0.1% - 0.3% and can reach 1.8% for adults over 50 years old.\nDiagnosis: Diagnosis of HAV infection requires specific serological testing for IgM antiHAV.

Total anti-HAV (the only other licensed serologic test) can be detected during\nacute infection but remains positive after recovery and for the remainder of the person’s\nlife.\nInfectivity: The infective dose of HAV is presumed to be low (10 to 100 viral particles),\nalthough the exact dose is unknown. The viral particles are excreted in the feces of ill\npeople (symptomatic and asymptomatic) at high densities (106 to 108\n/gm) and have\nbeen demonstrated to be excreted at these levels for up to 36 days post-infection.\nEvidence indicates maximum infectivity during the latter half of the incubation period,\ncontinuing for a few days after onset of jaundice. Most cases are probably\nnoninfectious after the first week of jaundice. Chronic shedding of HAV in feces has not\nbeen reported. HAV is shed at peak levels in the feces, one to two weeks before onset\nof symptoms, and shedding diminishes rapidly after liver dysfunction or symptoms\nappear.

In order to\nachieve comparable lethality, the food must attain a temperature of 74o\nC (165o\nF) in all\nparts of the food. Since cold spots may exist in food cooking in a microwave oven, it is\ncritical to measure the food temperature at multiple sites when the food is removed\nfrom the oven and then allow the food to stand covered for two minutes post microwave\nheating to allow thermal equalization and exposure. Although some microwave ovens\nare designed and engineered to deliver energy more evenly to the food than others, the\nimportant factor is to measure and ensure that the final temperature reaches 74o\nC\n(165o\nF) throughout the food.\n\"The factors that influence microwave thermal processes include many of the same\nfactors that are important in conventional processes (mass of objects, shape of objects,\nspecific heat and thermal conductivity, etc.).

Proper reheating provides a major\ndegree of assurance that pathogens will be eliminated. It is especially effective in\nreducing the numbers of Clostridium perfringens that may grow in meat, poultry, or\ngravy if these products were improperly cooled.

The CDC Surveillance Report and the results from the FDA Risk Factor\nStudies support the concept that operators of retail and food service establishments\nmust be proactive and implement food safety management systems that will prevent,\neliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. By reducing the\noccurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, foodborne illness can also be reduced.\n(D) How can the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors be reduced?\nTo effectively reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, operators of retail\nand food service establishments must focus their efforts on achieving active managerial\ncontrol. The term “active managerial control” is used to describe industry’s\nresponsibility for developing and implementing food safety management systems to\nprevent, eliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.\nActive managerial control means the purposeful incorporation of specific actions or\nprocedures by industry management into the operation of their business to attain\ncontrol over foodborne illness risk factors. It embodies a preventive rather than reactive\napproach to food safety through a continuous system of monitoring and verification.\nThere are many tools that can be used by industry to provide active managerial control\nof foodborne illness risk factors. Regulatory inspections and follow-up activities must\nalso be proactive by using an inspection process designed to assess the degree of\nactive managerial control that retail and food service operators have over the foodborne\nillness risk factors. In addition, regulators must assist operators in developing and\nimplementing voluntary strategies to strengthen existing industry systems to prevent the\noccurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.

It is reasoned that\nthermal inactivation of this organism would ensure destruction of all other vegetative\npathogens.\nFood manufacturers with adequate in-house research and development programs may\nhave the ability to design their own thermal processes. However, small retailers and\nsupermarkets may not be able to perform the microbiological challenge studies\nnecessary to provide the same level of food safety. If a retail establishment wishes to\nuse an ROP process with different time-temperature parameters from those provided in\nSection 3-502.12 of the Food Code, microbiological inoculation studies should be\nperformed by, or in conjunction with, an appropriate process authority or person\nknowledgeable in food microbiology who is acceptable to the regulatory authority.\n(4)\t Consumer Handling Practices and In-Home Refrigerator\n\nTemperatures\n\nExtended shelf life provided by ROP is cause for concern because of the potential for\nabuse by the consumer. Consumers often cannot, or do not, maintain adequate\nrefrigeration of time/temperature control for safety foods at home. Under the best of\ncircumstances, home refrigerators can be expected to range between 5o and 10o\nC (41o\n­\n50o\nF). One study reported that home refrigerator temperatures in 21% of the\nhouseholds surveyed were 10o\nC (50o\nF). Another study reported more than 1 of 4 home\nrefrigerators are above 7.2o\nC (45o\nF) and almost 1 of 10 are above 10o\nC (50o\nF). Thus,\nrefrigeration alone cannot be relied on for ensuring microbiological safety after foods in\nROP leave the establishment.\nAnnex 6 – Food Processing Criteria\n627\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers have come to expect that certain packages of foods would be safe without\nrefrigeration.
