    "content": "200. PRACTICE STANDARDS.\n01. Decision-Making Model. The decision-making model is the process by which a licensed nurse\nevaluates whether a particular act is within the legal scope of that nurse’s practice and determines whether to delegate\nthe performance of a particular nursing task in a given setting. This model applies to all licensure categories\npermitting active practice, regardless of practice setting. (3-28-23)\na. Determining Scope of Practice. To evaluate whether a specific act is within the legal scope of\nnursing practice, a licensed nurse shall determine whether: (3-28-23)\ni. The act is expressly prohibited by the Nursing Practice Act, or the act is limited to the scope of\npractice of advanced practice registered nurses or to licensed registered nurses, or the act is prohibited by other laws;\n(3-28-23)\nii. The act was taught as a part of the nurse’s educational institution’s required curriculum and the\nnurse possesses current clinical skills; (3-28-23)\niii. The act is consistent with standards of practice published by a national specialty nursing\norganization or supported by recognized nursing literature or reputable published research and the nurse can\ndocument successful completion of additional education through an organized program of study including supervised\nclinical practice or equivalent demonstrated competency; (3-28-23)\niv. Performance of the act is within the accepted standard of care that would be provided in a similar\nsituation by a reasonable and prudent nurse with similar education and experience and the nurse is prepared to accept\nthe consequences of the act. (3-28-23)\nb. Deciding to Delegate. When delegating nursing care, the licensed nurse retains accountability for\nthe delegated acts and the consequences of delegation. Before delegating any task the nurse shall: (3-28-23)\ni. Determine that the acts to be delegated are not expressly prohibited by the Nursing Practice Act or\nIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 24.34.01\nDiv. of Occupational & Professional Licenses Rules of the Idaho Board of Nursing\nSection 200 Page 13\nBoard rules and that the activities are consistent with job descriptions or policies of the practice setting; (3-28-23)\nii. Assess the patient’s status and health care needs prior to delegation, taking into consideration the\ncomplexity of assessments, monitoring required and the degree of physiological or psychological instability;\n(3-28-23)\niii. Exercise professional judgment to determine the safety of the delegated activities, to whom the acts\nmay be delegated, and the potential for harm; (3-28-23)\niv. Consider the nature of the act, the complexity of the care needed, the degree of critical thinking\nrequired and the predictability of the outcome of the act to be performed; (3-28-23)\nv. Consider the impact of timeliness of care, continuity of care, and the level of interaction required\nwith the patient and family; (3-28-23)\nvi. Consider the type of technology employed in providing care and the knowledge and skills required\nto effectively use the technology, including relevant infection control and safety issues; (3-28-23)\nvii. Determine that the person to whom the act is being delegated has documented education or training\nto perform the activity and is currently competent to perform the act; and (3-28-23)\nviii. Provide appropriate instruction for performance of the act. (3-28-23)\nc. Delegating to UAPs. (3-28-23)\ni. The nursing care tasks that may be delegated to UAPs shall be stated in writing in the practice\nsetting. Decisions concerning delegation will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 200 of these\nrules. UAPs may complement the licensed nurse in the performance of nursing functions, but cannot substitute for the\nlicensed nurse; UAPs cannot redelegate a delegated act. (3-28-23)\nii. Where permitted by law, after completion of a Board-approved training program, UAPs in care\nsettings may assist patients who cannot independently self-administer medications, provided that a plan of care has\nbeen developed by a licensed registered nurse, and the act has been delegated by a licensed nurse. Assistance with\nmedication may include: breaking a scored tablet, crushing a tablet, instilling eye, ear or nose drops, giving\nmedication through a pre-mixed nebulizer inhaler or gastric (non-nasogastric) tube, assisting with oral or topical\nmedications and insertion of suppositories. (3-28-23)\nd. Monitoring Delegation. Subsequent to delegation, the licensed nurse shall: (3-28-23)\ni. Evaluate the patient’s response and the outcome of the delegated act, and take such further action as\nnecessary; and (3-28-23)\nii. Determine the degree of supervision required and evaluate whether the activity is completed in a\nmanner that meets acceptable outcomes. The degree of supervision shall be based upon the health status and stability\nof the patient, the complexity of the care and the knowledge and competence of the individual to whom the activity is\ndelegated. (3-28-23)\n02. Standards of Conduct. (3-28-23)\na. License. (3-28-23)\ni. Reporting Grossly Negligent or Reckless Practice.
