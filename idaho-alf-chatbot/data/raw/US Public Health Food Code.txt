United States Public Health Service
Food and Drug Administration
The Food Code is a model for safeguarding public health and ensuring food is unadulterated
and honestly presented when offered to the consumer. It represents FDA's best advice for a
uniform system of provisions that address the safety and protection of food offered at retail
and in food service.
This model is offered for adoption by local, state, and federal governmental jurisdictions for
administration by the various departments, agencies, bureaus, divisions, and other units
within each jurisdiction that have been delegated compliance responsibilities for food service,
retail food stores, or food vending operations. Alternatives that offer an equivalent level of
public health protection to ensure that food at retail and foodservice is safe are recognized in
this model.

INTRODUCTION to the 2013 FOOD CODE
The federal government is committed to enhanced coordination with state, local, and tribal agencies,
and the food industry to protect our food supply, and the Food Code is one important element in this
strategy. HHS and USDA will continue to take progressive steps to partner with all who have a stake
in food safety, and are committed to reducing the incidence of foodbome illness in the United States.
This edition of the Food Code reflects our current understanding of evidenced-based practices for the
effective control of microbiological, chemical and physical hazards in food facilities that can cause
foodbome illness. Many of the changes to this edition reflect recommendations made at the 2012
biennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection, a national organization that affords scientists
and policy makers from all levels of government, industry, academia and consumers the opportunity to
propose and deliberate on improvements to the Food Code.
As of 2012, all 50 states and 3 of 6 territories report having retail codes patterned after previous
editions of the Food Code. We strongly encourage the adoption and implementation of the 2013 Food
Code at all levels of government.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food Safety and Inspection
Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are pleased to announce the release of the 2013
and eighth edition of the Food Code. The Food Code is a model code and reference document for
state, city, county and tribal agencies that regulate operations such as restaurants, retail food stores,
food vendors, and foodservice operations in institutions such as schools, hospitals, assisted living,
nursing homes and child care centers. Food safety practices at these facilities play a critical role in
preventing foodbome illness. The Food Code establishes practical, science-based guidance for
mitigating risk factors that are known to cause or contribute to foodbome illness outbreaks associated
with retail and foodservice establishments and is an important part of strengthening our nation's food
protection system.

1. FOODBORNE ILLNESS ESTIMATES, RISK FACTORS, AND INTERVENTIONS
Foodborne illness in the United States is a major cause of personal distress,
preventable illness and death, and avoidable economic burden. Scallan et al.
(2011a,b) estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 48 million illnesses,
128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths in the United States each year. The
occurrence of approximately 1,000 reported disease outbreaks (local, regional, and
national) each year highlights the challenges of preventing these infections.
Most foodborne illnesses occur in persons who are not part of recognized outbreaks.
For many victims, foodborne illness results only in discomfort or lost time from the job.
For some, especially preschool age children, older adults in health care facilities, and
those with impaired immune systems, foodborne illness is more serious and may be life
threatening.
The annual cost of foodborne illness in terms of pain and suffering, reduced
productivity, and medical costs are estimated to be $10 - $83 billion. As stated by
Meade et. al., the nature of food and foodborne illness has changed dramatically in the
United States over the last century. While technological advances such as
pasteurization and proper canning have all but eliminated some disease, new causes of
foodborne illness have been identified. Surveillance of foodborne illness is complicated
by several factors. The first is underreporting. Although foodborne illnesses can be
severe or even fatal, milder cases are often not detected through routine surveillance.
Second, many pathogens transmitted through food are also spread through water or
from person to person, thus obscuring the role of foodborne transmission. Finally,
pathogens or agents that have not yet been identified and thus cannot be diagnosed
cause some proportion of foodborne illness.
Preface i 



Epidemiological outbreak data repeatedly identify five major risk factors related to
employee behaviors and preparation practices in retail and food service establishments
as contributing to foodborne illness:
• Improper holding temperatures,
• Inadequate cooking, such as undercooking raw shell eggs,
• Contaminated equipment,
• Food from unsafe sources, and
• Poor personal hygiene
The Food Code addresses controls for risk factors and further establishes 5 key public
health interventions to protect consumer health. Specifically, these interventions are:
demonstration of knowledge, employee health controls, controlling hands as a vehicle
of contamination, time and temperature parameters for controlling pathogens, and the
consumer advisory. The first two interventions are found in Chapter 2 and the last
three in Chapter 3.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endeavors to assist the approximately 75
state and territorial agencies and more than 3,000 local departments that assume
primary responsibility for preventing foodborne illness and for licensing and inspecting
establishments within the retail segment of the food industry. This industry segment
consists of more than one million establishments and employs a work force of over 16
million.
2. PHS MODEL CODES HISTORY, PURPOSE, AND AUTHORITY
(A) History and Purpose
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) activities in the area of food protection began at the
turn of the 20th century with studies on the role of milk in the spread of disease. These
studies led to the conclusion that effective disease prevention requires the application
of comprehensive food sanitation measures from production to consumption.
Additional studies identified and evaluated measures which would most effectively
control disease, including work which led to improved processes for pasteurization.
Next, model codes were developed to assist state and local governments in initiating
and maintaining effective programs for prevention of foodborne illness. The first of
these, which is now titled Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance – Recommendations of
the PHS/FDA, was initially published in 1924. Subsequently, the PHS published
recommended model food codes that address the various components of the retail
segment of the food industry. These code editions are listed chronologically on pp. iii
and iv. Through the years all states, hundreds of local jurisdictions, and many federal
agencies have adopted some edition of model food codes recommended by the PHS.
Preface ii 






Today, FDA's purpose in maintaining an updated model food code is to assist food
control jurisdictions at all levels of government by providing them with a scientifically
sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail segment of the food industry.
The retail segment includes those establishments or locations in the food distribution
chain where the consumer takes possession of the food.
The model Food Code is neither federal law nor federal regulation and is not
preemptive. Rather, it represents FDA's best advice for a uniform system of regulation
to ensure that food at retail is safe and properly protected and presented. Although not
federal requirements (until adopted by federal bodies for use within federal
jurisdictions), the model Food Code provisions are designed to be consistent with
federal food laws and regulations, and are written for ease of legal adoption at all levels
of government. A list of jurisdictions that have reported to FDA their status in adopting
the Food Code is available on the FDA CFSAN Web Page at:
http://www.fda.gov/RetailFoodProtection. The list is self-reported and FDA has not yet
evaluated whether all the adopted codes are equivalent to the model Food Code.
Providing model food codes and model code interpretations and opinions is the
mechanism through which FDA, as a lead federal food control agency, promotes
uniform implementation of national food regulatory policy among the several thousand
federal, state, and local agencies and tribes that have primary responsibility for the
regulation or oversight of retail level food operations.
(B) Authority
PHS authority for providing assistance to state and local governments is derived from
the Public Health Service Act [42 USC 243]. Section 311(a) states in part:
"... The Secretary shall ... assist states and their political subdivisions in the prevention
and suppression of communicable diseases, and with respect to other public health
matters, shall cooperate with and aid state and local authorities in the enforcement of
their ... health regulations and shall advise the several states on matters relating to the
preservation and improvement of the public health." Responsibility for carrying out the
provisions of the Act relative to food protection was delegated within the PHS to the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs in 1968 [21 CFR 5.10(a)(2) and (3)].
Under authority of the Economy Act, June 30, 1932 as amended [31 USC 1535], FDA
provides assistance to federal agencies.
Assistance provided to local, state, and federal governmental bodies is also based on
FDA's authorities and responsibilities under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
[21 USC 301].
Preface iii 




3. PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS
It is a shared responsibility of the food industry and the government to ensure that food
provided to the consumer is safe and does not become a vehicle in a disease outbreak
or in the transmission of communicable disease. This shared responsibility extends to
ensuring that consumer expectations are met and that food is unadulterated, prepared
in a clean environment, and honestly presented.
Under FDA’s 2012 Mission Statement the agency is responsible for:
Protecting the public health by assuring the safety of our nation’s food supply…and for
advancing the public health by helping the public get accurate, science-based
information they need about foods to maintain and improve their health.
Accordingly, the provisions of the Food Code provide a system of prevention and
overlapping safeguards designed to minimize foodborne illness; ensure employee
health, industry manager knowledge, safe food, nontoxic and cleanable equipment, and
acceptable levels of sanitation on food establishment premises; and promote fair
dealings with the consumer.
4. ADVANTAGE OF UNIFORM STANDARDS
The advantages of well-written, scientifically sound, and up-to-date model codes have
long been recognized by industry and government officials.
Industry conformance with acceptable procedures and practices is far more likely where
regulatory officials "speak with one voice" about what is required to protect the public
health, why it is important, and which alternatives for compliance may be accepted.
Model codes provide a guide for use in establishing what is required. They are useful
to business in that they provide accepted standards that can be applied in training and
quality assurance programs. They are helpful to local, state, and federal governmental
bodies that are developing or updating their own codes.
The model Food Code provides guidance on food safety, sanitation, and fair dealing
that can be uniformly adopted for the retail segment of the food industry. The
document is the cumulative result of the efforts and recommendations of many
contributing individuals, agencies, and organizations with years of experience using
earlier model code editions. It embraces the concept that our quality of life, state of
health, and the public welfare are directly affected by how we collectively provide and
protect our food.
The model Food Code provisions are consistent with, and where appropriate
incorporate, federal performance standards for the same products and processes.
Federal performance standards in effect define public food safety expectations for the
Preface iv 





product, usually in terms of lethality to a pathogenic microorganism of particular
concern. Use of performance standards as the measure of regulatory compliance
means establishments are free to use innovative approaches in producing safe
products, in lieu of adherence to traditional processing approaches, such as specified
cooking times and temperatures, that achieve the same end. Federally inspected
establishments demonstrate compliance with performance standards by showing that
their process adheres to an appropriately designed, validated HACCP plan.
Retail processors may be given the same opportunity as federally-regulated
establishments to use innovative techniques in the production of safe foods. Retail
establishments may apply to the regulatory authority for a variance to use a specific
federal food safety performance standard for a product or a process in lieu of
compliance with otherwise applicable specifications in the Food Code. However, to
show compliance with the federal performance standard, the retail processor must, like
a federally inspected establishment, show that processing controls are in place to
ensure that the standard is being met. Thus, a request for a variance based on a
federal performance standard must be supported by a validated HACCP plan with
record keeping and documented verification being made available to the regulatory
authority.
5. MODIFICATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS EDITION
The revisions contained in this edition reflect changes, additions, deletions, and format
modifications listed in the Supplement to the 2009 FDA Food Code and
recommendations developed during the 2012 Biennial meeting of the Conference for
Food Protection. The revisions also reflect input provided by those who have been
intimately involved with studying, teaching, and using the earlier editions. Most of these
enhancements involve added clarification or new information. Some reflect evolving
regulatory policy contained in new or revised federal regulations.
Several of the Tables, Charts, and images were converted throughout the Code to meet
web accessibility requirements under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29
U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 mandates that all federal agencies eliminate the barriers in
accessing electronic and information technology. The law helps to ensure that
members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government
information and services.
The needed clarifications and missing Code provisions were identified by FDA and
others during standardization and certification activities, State Training Team courses,
regional food protection seminars, the deliberations of food equipment standards
organizations, and the verbal and written requests for clarification received by FDA field
and headquarters components.
Preface v 





Changes in provisions related to federal laws and regulations administered by other
federal agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture were jointly
developed with those agencies.
In the 2009 FDA Food Code a revised designation system for Code provisions was
introduced. In the 2013 edition of the FDA Food Code, Annex 7 Form 3-A Food
Establishment Inspection Report and Guide 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food
Establishment Inspection Report were updated to reflect the revised designation
system.
A Summary of Changes is provided at the end of the Food Code. General
enhancements include:
(1) Added and improved definitions that are more precise and more consistent with
terminology and definitions found in related laws and regulations;
(2) Modified provisions to make them more consistent with national requirements
and standards administered by other federal agencies and international bodies; more
flexible without compromising public health; and more internally consistent with other
Food Code provisions;
(3) Clarified other provisions regarding their intent, thereby reducing confusion and
the potential for inconsistent application;
(4) Improved user aids contained in the Annexes such as added references and
updated public health reasons, model forms, guides, and lists; and
(5) Expanded the Index with additional terms to assist a broader base of users in
finding topics of interest.
6. DISCUSSION OF THE CODE AS A HACCP MODEL AND THE INTENTION TO
INCORPORATE OTHER MODELS
It is important to note that preapproval of HACCP plans for food establishments
operating pursuant to a variance is provided for under the Food Code, but such a plan
preapproval is not a part of another HACCP regulatory model, the Fish and Fishery
Products regulation 21 CFR 123, effective December 18, 1997. FDA published the
Fish and Fisheries Hazards and Controls Guidance Fourth Edition April 2011.
Additionally, there are differences between the two models in the required content of
the HACCP plan. For example, the HACCP plans requested by the Food Code must
include flow diagrams, product formulations, training plans, and a corrective action plan.
Flow diagrams and product formulations are suggested but not mandated components
of the Fish and Fishery Products regulation.
Preface vi 






These differences are necessitated by differences in the nature of the regulations and
the regulatory structure set up to enforce them. HACCP plans developed under the
Food Code variance process are provided to the regulatory authority to enable the
regulatory authority to assess whether the establishment has designed a system of
controls sufficient to ensure the safety of the product. The plans will be reviewed
outside the food establishment and, in most cases, in the absence of any historical
performance information for the product at that establishment. Therefore, the plan
must contain sufficient detail to allow the regulator to fully understand the operations
and the intended controls. Products requiring a variance are those which are deemed
to be time/temperature control for safety food and for which retail production would
otherwise be prohibited.
To assist food establishments in applying HACCP principles at retail, FDA has issued a
document entitled: Managing Food Safety: A HACCP Principles Guide for Operators of
Food Service, Retail Food Stores, and Other Food Establishments at the Retail Level.
This document is available from FDA and can be found on the FDA Web Page at:
http://www.fda.gov/RetailFoodProtection.
Under the Fish and Fishery Products regulation, every seafood processor is required to
perform a hazard analysis, and must have and implement a written HACCP Plan
whenever a hazard analysis reveals a food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to
occur. HACCP plans developed pursuant to the Fish and Fishery Products regulation
are for all products in the class and are not for products for which production is
presently prohibited. Plans will be reviewed on site, with records available to judge,
among other things, the adequacy of past corrective actions.
It is intended that the Food Code will be amended to incorporate federal HACCP
regulations and guidelines by inclusion in the text of the Food Code, by reference, or
through the issuance of interpretations. This will provide alternatives to the preapproval
of HACCP plans, such as simplified HACCP plans in line with the Fish and Fishery
Products model, if the product is produced under a HACCP plan developed in
conformance with such regulation or guideline. In so doing, the need for preapproved
plans under the more intensive regimen of the Food Code will be significantly reduced.
HACCP plans are key to the use of performance standards as measures of regulatory
compliance. Performance standards issued by the Food Safety and Inspection Service
are applicable to a broad range of meat, poultry, and egg products. Federal
performance standards are acceptable, equivalent alternatives to the command-andcontrol provisions that now provide specific times and temperatures for processing
various products. Federal performance standards may be used to determine the safety
of a product or process under the Food Code if authorized under a variance granted in
accord with the Code’s variance provisions, and demonstrated by adherence to a
validated HACCP plan, consistent with the Code’s HACCP provisions.
Preface vii 







7. CODE ADOPTION/CERTIFIED COPIES
The model Food Code is provided for use by food regulatory jurisdictions at all levels of
government. At the state and local levels the model may be:
(A) Enacted into statute as an act of the state legislative body;
(B) Promulgated as a regulation, if the state legislative body has delegated rulemaking authority to a governmental administrative agency; or

(C) Adopted as an ordinance, if the local legislative body has been delegated rulemaking authority or regulatory powers.
Typically, code adoption bodies publish a notice of their intent to adopt a code, make
copies available for public inspection, and provide an opportunity for public input prior to
adoption. This is usually done in one of two ways.
The recommended method is the "short form" or "adoption by reference" approach
where a simple statement is published stating that certified copies of the proposed code
are on file for public review. This approach may be used by governmental bodies
located in states that have enabling laws authorizing the adoption of codes by
reference. An advantage to this approach is a substantial reduction in the cost of
publishing and printing.
Certified copies of the Food Code for use in adopting the model by reference are
available through the FDA Retail Food Protection Team, HFS-320, 5100 Paint Branch
Parkway, College Park, MD 20740-3835. Refer to item 2. (A) of this Preface to access
a listing of jurisdictions’ adoptions.
The alternative method is the "long form" or "section-by-section" approach where the
proposed code is published in its entirety.
Both methods of adoption allow for the modification of specific provisions to
accommodate existing law, administrative procedure, or regulatory policy. Annex 7
contains model adoption forms for use by governmental bodies who wish to use either
of these methods.
8. INFORMATION TO ASSIST THE USER
Many of the improvements contained in the model Food Code, as listed under item 5 of
this Preface, are provided to make the document easier to use. Other characteristics of
the new edition, if they are understood by the user, make it easier to follow and apply.
These include structure, nomenclature, and methodology.
Preface viii 












Food Code provisions address essentially four areas: personnel (Chapter 2), food
(Chapter 3), equipment/facilities/supplies (Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7), and compliance and
enforcement (Chapter 8). A new user will find it helpful to review the Table of Contents
together with the Code Reference Sheet (Annex 7, Guide 3-B) in order to quickly gain
an understanding of the scope and sequence of subjects included within these four
areas. The structural nomenclature of the document is as follows:
Chapter 9
Part 9-1
Subpart 9-101
Section (§) 9-101.11
Paragraph (¶) 9-101.11(A)
Subparagraph 9-101.11(A)(1)
Code provisions are either appropriate for citing and debiting on an inspection report or
they are not. Those not intended for citing/debiting are identified by the digits following
the decimal point in the numbering system. These “nondebitable” provisions fall into
two categories, those that end with two digits after the decimal point and the last digit is
a zero, e.g., § 1-201.10; and those that end with three digits after the decimal point and
the last 2 digits are zeros, e.g., § 8-805.100.
Two types of internal cross referencing are widely used throughout the Code to
eliminate the need for restating provisions.
A. The first type of cross reference uses phrases that contain the word “under”,
e.g., “as specified under … (followed by the relevant portion of the Code).”
The purpose of this type of cross reference is to:
1) Alert the reader to relevant information, and
2) Provide a system by which each violation is recorded under the one most
appropriate provision. This type of cross reference signals to the reader
the provision of the Code under which a certain violation is properly
cited/debited.
B. The second type of cross reference uses phrases that contain the word “in,” e.g.,
“as specified in... (followed by the relevant portion of the Code).”
The purpose of this type of cross reference is to:
1) Indicate the specific provisions of a separate document such as a federal
regulation that are being incorporated by reference in the requirement of
the Code, e.g., ¶ 3-201.11(C); or
Preface ix 








2) Refer the reader to a nondebitable provision of the Code which provides
further information for consideration, such as provision for an exception or
for an allowance to comply via an alternative method.
For example, ¶ 3-201.16 (A) begins with “Except as specified in ¶ (B)…”
and ¶ (B) states the relevant exceptions to ¶ (A). Paragraph 3-201.11(E)
states in part, “… as specified in ¶ 3-401.11(C)” and ¶ 3-401.11(C)
provides for an allowance to serve or sell raw or undercooked, wholemeat, intact beef steaks in a ready-to-eat form.
If you review the exception in ¶ 3-201.16(B) and the allowance in
¶ 3-401.11(C), you will see that exceptions and allowances often contain
conditions of compliance, i.e., conditions that must be met in order for the
exception or allowance to convey.
Based on the violation being cited, the substance of the text being referred to, and the
context in which the reference is made, users of the Code must infer the intent of the
cross reference. That is, the user must determine if the cross reference simply alerts
the user to additional information about the requirement or if the cross reference:
•	 sends (via the word “under”) the citing/debiting to another Code provision;
or
•	 incorporates (via the word “in”) the referenced requirements into the Code
provision.
The Food Code presents requirements by principle rather than by subject. For
example, equipment requirements are presented under headings such as Materials,
Design and Construction, Numbers and Capacities, Location and Installation, and
Maintenance and Operation rather than by refrigerators, sinks, and thermometers. In
this way provisions need be stated only once rather than repeated for each piece or
category of equipment. Where there are special requirements for certain equipment,
the requirement is delineated under the appropriate principle (e.g., Design and
Construction) and listed separately in the index.
Portions of some sections are written in italics. These provisions are not requirements,
but are provided to convey relevant information about specific exceptions and
alternative means for compliance. Italics are pursuant to a preceding provision that
states a requirement, to which the italics offer an exception or another possibility.
Italicized sections usually involve the words “except for,” “may”, “need not” or “does not
apply.” See ¶ 3-202.18(D).
The former use of “critical” or “non-critical” has been changed in recognition of the need
to better identify risk-based controls within the Code’s provisions. Requirements
contained in the Food Code are presented as being in one of three categories of
importance: PRIORITY ITEM (i.e. a provision in this Code whose application
Preface x 









contributes directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction to an acceptable level,
hazards associated with foodborne illness or injury and there is no other provision that
more directly controls the hazard); PRIORITY FOUNDATION ITEM (i.e., a provision in
this Code whose application supports, facilitates or enables one or more PRIORITY
ITEMS); and, CORE ITEM (i.e., a provision in this Code that is not designated as a
PRIORITY ITEM or a PRIORITY FOUNDATION ITEM and that usually relates to
general sanitation, operational controls, sanitation standard operating procedures
(SSOPs), facilities or structures, equipment design, or general maintenance.
A “P
” or “Pf” designation after a paragraph or subparagraph indicates that the provision
within that section is a PRIORITY ITEM or PRIORITY FOUNDATION ITEM. Any unmarked
provisions within a section are CORE ITEMS.
The following conventions are used in the Food Code. “Shall” means the act is
imperative, i.e., “shall” constitutes a command. “May not” means absolute prohibition.
“May” is permissive and means the act is allowed. The term “means” is followed by a
declared fact.
Defined words and terms are in “small caps” in the text of the Food Code chapters to
alert the reader to the fact that there is a specific meaning assigned to those words and
terms and that the meaning of a provision is to be interpreted in the defined context. A
concerted effort was also made to place in “small caps” all forms and combinations of
those defined words and terms that were intended to carry the weight of the definition.
The annexes located at the back of the document can provide tremendous assistance
to those charged with applying Food Code provisions. No reference is made in the text
of a provision to the annexes which support its requirements. This is necessary in order
to keep future laws or other requirements based on the model Food Code "clean."
However, the annexes are provided specifically to assist the regulatory authority apply
the provisions uniformly and effectively.
It is, therefore, important for users to preview the subject and essence of each of the
annexes before using the document. Some of the annexes (e.g., References, Public
Health Reasons) are structured to present the information by the specific Food Code
item number to which they apply. Other annexes provide information and materials
intended to be helpful to the user such as model forms that can be used, a delineation
of the principles of HACCP, guidelines for establishment inspection, and criteria for
certain food processes for use in evaluating proposed HACCP plans.

9. THE CODE REVISION PROCESS
(A) Food Code Revision and Publication Cycles
FDA is issuing a new edition of the Food Code every 4 years. During the 4-year span
of time between editions, FDA may issue supplements to an existing edition. Each new
edition will incorporate the changes made in the supplement as well as any new
revisions.
(B) Submission of Food Code Change Suggestions
FDA will continue to receive concerns and recommendations for modification of the
Food Code from any individual or organization.
Given the purpose of the document as discussed in item 2 of this Preface, the Agency
will be especially interested in addressing problems identified by those in government
and industry who are responsible for implementing the Food Code. FDA will also be
especially responsive to those needed policy and technical changes raised by an
organization that uses a democratic process for addressing problems and concerns.
Included are organizations that provide a process that encourages representative
participation in deliberations by government, industry, and academic and consumer
interests, followed by public health ratification such as a state-by-state vote by officially
designated delegates. The Conference for Food Protection (retail food issues), the
National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (milk and dairy products issues), and
the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (molluscan shellfish issues) are examples
of such organizations. These organizations receive problems submitted by any
interested individual, but specify the forms on which the issues must be detailed and
provide specific time frames during which they may be submitted.
FDA encourages interested individuals to consider raising issues and suggesting
solutions involving the federal-state cooperative programs based on FDA's model codes
through these organizations.
10. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Many individuals devoted considerable time and effort in addressing concerns and
developing recommendations that are now reflected in the Food Code. These
individuals represent a wide diversity of regulators, educators, industry leaders, and
consumer representatives acting through their agencies, companies, professional
groups, or trade organizations. It is only through the dedicated efforts and contributions
of experienced professionals that a scientifically sound, well focused, and up-to-date
model code is possible. FDA acknowledges with gratitude the substantial assistance of
those who contributed to public health and food safety in the development of the Food
Code.

3. PRINCIPLE
4. RECOMMENDATION
5. PARTS
8-6 CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION
8-7 AUTHORITY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Annex is to set forth provisions, in codified form, that provide a full
array of enforcement mechanisms while recognizing the diverse statutes and
regulations that currently govern the operations of the thousands of State and local
regulatory agencies.
2. EXPLANATION
State or local statutes, regulations, and ordinances vary in their design, specificity, and
degree of comprehensiveness in that they may:
(A) Contain authorities that provide the basis for certain post-inspection
compliance strategies but remain silent with respect to other enforcement
mechanisms;
(B) Include specific requirements that are different from those provided in this
Annex; and
(C) Be structured so that provisions such as administrative procedures are
embodied in sections of the law that transcend and are separate from those
governing food establishments.
Annex 1 – Compliance & Enforcement
221
 

Consequently, in this document a deliberate attempt is made to extract those provisions
that could conceptually be adopted as an extension of Chapter 8 if they were
compatible with existing, governing State and local statutes. The extracted provisions
are numbered to sequentially follow Chapter 8 but are placed in this Annex so that
regulatory agencies can revise them to be consistent with their statutes and their needs
as discussed in the Recommendation, below.
It is anticipated that adoption of this Code will be facilitated by the fact that:
(A) The compliance provisions of Chapter 8 that should be an integral part of
State or local food regulations are part of the text of the Code; and
(B) The administrative and judicial enforcement provisions that are critical to the
framework of a food regulatory program, but that may be repetitive or discrepant
when compared to State or local statutes, are separated in this Annex.
3. PRINCIPLE
Although the situations necessitating escalated enforcement actions comprise a small
percentage of those encountered by the regulator, a full spectrum of enforcement tools
must be available where immediate hazards exist, or where compliance is not obtained
voluntarily. Thus, a jurisdiction must have in place both the necessary statutory
framework that includes a broad-based, well-defined enforcement component and
regulations that specify the requirements within those legal authorities. It is imperative
that there be clearly stated and legally sound rules that include the criteria for
compliance and enforcement, the responsibilities of all parties, sanctions for
noncompliance, and due process guarantees.
4. RECOMMENDATION
FDA recommends that agencies assess their statutory provisions that pertain to food
establishments in light of this Annex and consider proposing changes to their statutes
and regulations where they determine that provisions contained within this Annex will
strengthen their programs. Such an assessment may involve reviewing problems
encountered in attempts to prosecute under existing State or local provisions;
considering comments received by the regulatory authority about its enforcement
process; consulting with staff and legal counsel to identify gaps or weaknesses in the
provisions; comparing provisions with sister agencies for comprehensiveness, equity,
and uniformity; and seeking input from outside sources that have experience in taking,
or being the subject of, enforcement actions.

subparagraph shall not apply to a safe nonnutritive substance which is in or
on confectionery by reason of its use for some practical functional purpose in
the manufacture, packaging, or storage of such confectionery if the use of the
substance does not promote deception of the consumer or otherwise result in
adulteration or misbranding in violation of any provision of this chapter,
except that the Secretary may, for the purpose of avoiding or resolving
uncertainty as to the application of this subparagraph, issue regulations
allowing or prohibiting the use of particular nonnutritive substances.

under conditions that do not meet current good manufacturing practice
regulations, including regulations requiring, when necessary, expiration date
labeling, issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (2).

for dietary supplements. Such regulations shall be modeled after current
good manufacturing practice regulations for food and may not impose
standards for which there is no current and generally available analytical

A.	 Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards
This document can be accessed at the following web site:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/
default.htm and was formulated from ideas and input by Federal, State, and local
regulatory officials, industry, trade and professional associations, academia, and
consumers. The purposes of these standards are:
 To serve as a bench mark to retail food regulatory program managers in
the design and management of a retail food program;
 To provide a means of recognition of programs meeting these
standards;
 To promote uniformity in retail food programs to reduce the risk factors
known to cause foodborne illness;
 To provide a foundation for the food regulatory program that is focused
on the risk factors and other factors that may contribute to foodborne
illness; and
 To promote, through the management of a retail food regulatory
program, the active managerial control in the retail establishment of all
the factors that may cause foodborne illness.
Further purposes of these standards are to serve as a guide to regulatory retail food
program managers in the design and management of a retail food program and to
provide a means of recognition for those programs that meet these standards.
The intent in the development of these standards is to establish a basic foundation in
design and management of a retail food program. Program management may add
additional requirements to meet individual program needs.
Annex 2 – References
312
 
The standards apply to the operation and management of a regulatory retail food
program focused on the reduction of risk factors known to cause foodborne illness as
well as other factors that may contribute to foodborne illness and on the promotion of
active managerial control of all factors that may cause foodborne illness.
B.	 FDA Procedures for Standardization and Certification of Retail Food
Inspection/Training Officers
This document can be found by accessing the following web site:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/InspectionsQualityA
ssurance/ucm2006814.htm. This is a procedure that integrates the assessment of an
individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities in a manageable number of inspections while
preserving the quality and integrity of the process. At the same time, we continue to
learn from our experiences in applying it and remain open to improving these
Procedures based on your experiences and feedback.
As they are written, the Procedures address the situation wherein an FDA Standard is
assessing a CANDIDATE who is not employed by FDA. For example, Paragraph
3-301(C) mentions but does not require recording citations (i.e., identifying the codified
provision that relates to each observed violation). Since jurisdiction's codification
systems (numeric or alphanumeric) are usually different from the system in the FDA
Food Code, the utility of that practice would be minimal in an FDA-to-jurisdiction field
exercise. However, within a jurisdiction where the same Code is in use, the practice
could be useful in reinforcing diligence in ensuring that violations listed during
inspections are, in fact, soundly based in regulation.
FDA invites and encourages jurisdictions to use these Procedures in their internal
Standardization and Certifications and to add dimensions that promote uniformity such
as citing codified provisions, as discussed above. With a few language changes, the
document can be custom-tailored to fit individual jurisdictions and serve as their
procedures. As with other documents provided as guidance for applying regulatory
requirements in the retail sector, these Procedures are in the "public domain" and we
encourage their duplication and use.

C.	 Managing Food Safety: A Manual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles for
Operators of Food Service and Retail Establishments
The Operator’s Manual can be found by accessing the following web site:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm. FDA has
issued guidance to industry in voluntarily applying HACCP principles in food
establishments. It recognizes that there are differences between using HACCP at retail
and in food manufacturing. By incorporating the seven principles of HACCP, a good
set of Standard Operating Procedures, and using a process approach, this Guide sets
up a framework for the retail food industry to develop and implement a sound food
safety management system.
This document is intended to serve as a guide in the writing of a simple plan based on
HACCP principles that can be used to manage food safety. It is very important to
understand that this Guide is intended to assist industry's voluntary implementation of
HACCP principles. It is not meant to stand alone, but instead should be used together
with advice from and in consultation with your Federal, State, local, or tribal food safety
regulatory authority. The regulatory authority is an important resource for reviewing
your food safety management system. Regulatory food safety professionals can
provide important information for the public health rationale for controlling a particular
hazard. Users of this document also need to consult and use the latest edition of the
FDA Food Code since many of its requirements are not reproduced here but constitute
a fundamental program that is prerequisite to implementing a HACCP program.
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a common sense technique to
control food safety hazards. It is a preventive system of hazard control rather than a
reactive one. Food establishments can use it to ensure safer food products for
consumers. It is not a zero risk system, but is designed to minimize the risk of food
safety hazards. HACCP is not a stand alone program but is one part of a larger system
of control procedures that must be in place in order for HACCP to function effectively.
These control procedures are prerequisite programs and are discussed more in
Annex 4.
The success of a HACCP program is dependent upon both people and facilities.
Management and employees must be properly motivated and trained if a HACCP
program is to successfully reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Education and
training in the principles of food safety and management commitment to the
implementation of a HACCP system are critical and must be continuously reinforced.
Instilling food worker commitment and dealing with problems such as high employee
turnover and communication barriers must be considered when designing a HACCP
plan.
Annex 2 – References
314
 




Successful implementation of a HACCP plan is also dependent upon the design and
performance of facilities and equipment. The likelihood of the occurrence of a hazard
in a finished product is definitely influenced by facility and equipment design,
construction, and installation that play a key role in any preventive strategy.
The Agency recognizes that this document has areas that need to be further clarified
and developed with broader input and based on industry’s experiences with the
practicalities of integrating the HACCP approach in their operations. This Guide will
continue to evolve and improve.
D.	 Managing Food Safety: A Regulator’s Manual for Applying HACCP Principles to
Risk-based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary Food
Safety Management Systems
The Regulator’s Manual can be found by accessing the following website:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm. This
document provides State, local, and tribal regulatory authorities with a step-by-step
scheme for conducting risk-based inspections based on HACCP principles to assist
them with identifying and assessing control of foodborne illness risk factors. In addition,
the manual details intervention strategies that can be developed with retail and food
service operators to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. It also
provides recommendations for evaluating voluntarily-implemented food safety
management systems if invited to do so by industry.
The utilization of voluntary food safety management systems by industry and the
incorporation of risk-based methodology into regulatory inspection programs are
important elements in reaching the goals established by the Healthy People 2010
health improvement strategy and FDA retail program goals.
In 2004, the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) endorsed both documents with a
recommendation that both industry and regulatory entities consider implementing the
principles of the documents into their respective food safety programs. The CFP is
composed of regulators, industry, academia, professional organizations, and
consumers whose purpose is to identify problems, formulate recommendations, and
develop and implement practices that relate to food safety.
A Federal Register notice announcing the availability of these documents was
published July 21, 2005 (Docket No. 2005D-0274).

E.	 Food Establishment Plan Review Guide
This document can be found at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat
oryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm101639.htm. This Food Establishment Plan
Review document has been developed for the purpose of assisting both regulatory and
industry personnel in achieving greater uniformity in the plan review process. It is the
result of a joint effort by FDA and the Conference for Food Protection.
Plan review of food service establishments, retail food stores, and all other food
operations, must be maintained as a high priority by all regulatory food agencies for
both new and existing facilities.
This document has been developed to serve as a guide in facilitating greater uniformity
and ease in conducting plan review whether your position is a regulator or an industry
person wishing to build or to expand. You need not be an expert to effectively complete
this process.
A good review of plans helps to avoid future problems. By listing and locating
equipment on floor plans and diagramming specifications for electrical, mechanical and
plumbing systems, potential problems can be spotted while still on paper and
modifications made BEFORE costly purchases, installation and construction.
Food establishment plan review is recognized as an important food program component
that allows:
-- Regulatory agencies to ensure that food establishments are built or renovated
according to current regulations or rules.
-- Industry to establish an organized and efficient flow of food.
-- Regulatory agencies to eliminate code violations prior to construction.
F. FDA Report on the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected
Institutional Foodservice, Restaurant, and Retail Food Store Facility Types (2004)
In 1998, FDA initiated a project designed to determine the incidence of foodborne
illness risk factors in retail and food service establishments. Inspections focusing on
the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors were conducted in establishments
throughout the United States. The results of this project are published in the 2000
Report of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors,
commonly referred to as the “FDA Baseline Report.” The Baseline Report is available
from FDA through the following website:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM123546.pdf. The data
collection project was repeated in 2003 and the results are published in the FDA Report
on the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected Institutional

Foodservice, Restaurant, and Retail Food Store Facility Types (2004). This second
report is available from FDA through the following website:

skFactorReduction/ucm089696.htm. An additional data collection project is planned for
2008.
G.	 Growing Sprouts in a Retail Food Establishment
This document, Growing Sprouts in a Retail Food Establishment, can be found at the
web site
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ucm078758.htm .
There were 25 reported outbreaks associated with raw and lightly cooked seed sprouts
in the United States between January 1996 and December 2003. No single treatment
so far has been shown to completely eliminate pathogens on seeds or sprouts without
affecting germination or yield; therefore a combination of factors is used to eliminate
and control potential pathogens and assure a safe, ready-to-eat food product. Seeds or
beans grown using Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and conditioned, transported,
and stored according to GMPs reduce the potential for seed to serve as a source of
contamination. Retail Sprouting Industry Best Practices help ensure that no further
contamination occurs and precautionary measures are taken to prevent high levels of
bacteria from growing on the seeds or sprouts. Seeds for sprouting or sprouts should
receive a chemical disinfection treatment that has been approved by EPA for reduction
of pathogens. Other treatments such as irradiation of seeds [21 CFR 179.26(b)(10)]
have been approved. Because no treatments are known to completely eliminate
pathogens without adversely affecting germination or yield, microbial testing of spent
irrigation water from the sprouting process is also necessary to verify that no pathogens
are present. Raw sprouts are considered time/temperature control for safety food
(TCS) and therefore, require refrigeration.
H.	 Advisories for Retail Processing with Proper Controls and Variances for Product
Safety
These documents are available for purchase at minimum cost from the Association of
Food and Drug Officials (AFDO) at the website http://www.afdo.org/. These guides
were funded by USDA through the University of Florida in cooperation with Florida A&M
University and the Association of Food and Drug Officials and developed by experts
from academic, regulatory, and industry areas. Nine guides help retailers and
regulatory personnel understand the food safety controls to implement in retail food and
food service operations in order to process and sell safe food products. They can also
be used as a reference in applying for or reviewing a variance and HACCP Plan, where
required, for retail processing of beef jerky, cured and hot smoked sausage, cured and
smoked ham, fermented and dried sausage, fresh-cut produce, fresh juice, reduced
oxygen packaging (ROP), smoked seafood, and sushi.
Annex 2 – References
317
 


Each guide provides a definition of terms, a flow diagram, and a detailed check list for
operations including receiving, food storage, preparation, and display. Information in
the Appendices helps identify specific food safety hazards associated with that product,
necessary equipment calibrations, product labeling, recommended record keeping with
sample log sheets, and a daily SOP check list. Authoritative sources are also
referenced such as FDA’s “Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards & Controls Guidance”
and 21 CFR 101 for labeling requirements.
These guides are not intended to replace or duplicate existing regulations within the
jurisdictions of the regulatory authority or food establishment but they offer information
and references for more uniform practices.
I. Evaluation and Definition of Potentially Hazardous Foods
This document can be found at the web site
http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm0
94141.htm . The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) prepared and submitted this
report as part of a contract with FDA. It contains responses to various questions posed
by FDA about time/temperature control for safety food (TCS food). The IFT reviewed
the evolution of the term TCS and recommended a change to time/temperature control
for safety (TCS) food as well as a science-based framework for determining the
effectiveness of processing technologies that formulate a food so that it is non-TCS.
The IFT Science and Technology Expert Panel reviewed the two protocols used by
NSF International and the American Baking Association for determining if a food is a
TCS and proposed an alternate approach. The report examines intrinsic factors such
as aw, pH, redox potential, natural and added antimicrobials and competitive
microorganisms, and extrinsic factors such as packaging, atmospheres, storage
conditions, processing steps, and new preservation technologies that influence
microbial growth. The report also analyzes microbial hazards related to
time/temperature control of foods for safety.
The IFT developed a framework that could be used to determine whether a food is a
TCS food or not. Part of the framework includes two tables that consider the interaction
of pH and aw in a food, whether the food is raw or heat-treated, and whether it is
packaged. When further product assessment is required, the application of
microbiological challenge testing (inoculation studies) is discussed along with pathogen
modeling programs and reformulation of the food. An extensive reference list is
included in the report.

J.	 The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Guide, “How to
Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act: A Guide for Restaurants and
Other Food Service Employers” October 28, 2004
The guide is designed to assist restaurants and other food service employers in
complying with the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The EEOC worked extensively with the Food and Drug Administration in developing this
new publication.
Available online at http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide.html,
http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide_summary.html, and www.fda.gov, the guide
covers such topics as how the FDA Food Code provisions about restricting and
excluding sick employees interact with the ADA’s requirements; types of reasonable
accommodations, including the use of service animals; and what an employer should
do if a charge of discrimination is filed against the employer’s business.
Title I of the ADA, which prohibits employment discrimination against people with
disabilities in the private sector and State and local governments, and the Rehabilitation
Act’s prohibitions against disability discrimination in the federal government. The EEOC
enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment
discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin; the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits discrimination against individuals 40
years of age or older; the Equal Pay Act; and sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
K.	 Guidance for Retail Facilities Regarding Beef Grinding Logs Tracking Supplier
Information
This document may be found at the web site for “Compliance Guidelines for
Establishments on the FSIS Microbiological Testing Program and Other Verification
Activities for Escherichia coli O157:H7” at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/f5001b3d-defa-4db8-a510­
881ca90415ff/ecolio157h7dirguid4-13-04.pdf?MOD=AJPERES. On October 7, 2002,
USDA/FSIS published a Federal Register Notice (67 FR 62332) entitled, E. coli
O157:H7 Contamination of Beef Products, available at
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2002_register&docid=02­
25504-filed.pdf, in which the Agency discussed its views on the application of the
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system regulations with respect to
Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 contamination.
USDA/FSIS announced in 2002 that there is sufficient new scientific data on the
increased prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in live cattle coming to slaughter and on its
impact on public health to require that all establishments producing raw beef products
reassess their HACCP plans, in light of these data.
Annex 2 – References
319
 







Of particular concern to the USDA/FSIS is its ability to quickly and adequately
traceback contaminated product that is in commerce to its source and to remove it from
commerce. In the Spring of 2004, FSIS began conducting sampling and
microbiological verification testing for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef products at
federally inspected establishments, retail facilities as well as at import facilities. Some
of the products most likely to be sampled and tested at retail facilities are:
•	 Ground beef products produced from retail steaks and roasts.
•	 Manufacturing trimmings derived at retail.
•	 Ground beef that is formulated at retail by co-mingling in-store trim and trim from
federally inspected establishments.
•	 Irradiated ground beef co-mingled with non-irradiated meat or poultry.
Additionally, ground beef products have been implicated as a transmission vehicle in
foodborne outbreaks of infections with pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7
and Salmonella. To facilitate product traceback and to meet regulatory requirements,
USDA/FSIS expects retail facilities as well as federally inspected establishments to
maintain and provide FSIS with access to all applicable records associated with the
source material used for ground beef products. In cases where USDA/FSIS identifies
adulterated ground beef, and a product recall is necessary, grinding logs will facilitate
identifying the source of the product and narrowing the scope of the recall.
FSIS recently published “Sanitation Guidance for Beef Grinders” which contains an
example of a fresh ground beef production log. The guidance is located at the following
website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/Sanitation_Guidance_Beef_Grinders.pdf.
The following information would be used to facilitate traceback of contaminated ground
beef products:
•	 The manufacturer name of source material used for product produced.
•	 The type of product or description of the purchased or received article(s).
•	 The establishment information from the label of source product used such as the
name, address, and establishment number
•	 The supplier lot numbers, product code or production or pack date of source
materials used.
•	 Any other information that would be useful in the quick removal of adulterated
product from the market or commerce such as time of grind, grinder sanitation
records and amount (in pounds) and lot/batch numbers, production codes, name
and package size of the products produced.

L. Recommended Guidelines for Permanent Outdoor Cooking Establishments, 2003
This document can be found at http://www.foodprotect.org/guides/ . Permanent
Outdoor Cooking Establishments (POCE) include a wide range of facilities from
barbecue pits at beach resorts to campfire meals at dude ranches, pig roasts and clam
bakes, and multi-menu food service sites in amusement and theme parks. It is
essential that the equipment and physical facility requirements be based upon a menu
review of the items to be prepared, cooked, held, and served. Many of these POCEs
are high risk operations engaging in extensive preparation of raw ingredients:
processes that include the cooking, hot and cold holding, and reheating of
time/temperature control for safety foods. These guidelines provide the basis on which
regulatory authorities can evaluate and permit permanent outdoor cooking
establishments.
M. Comprehensive Guidelines for Food Recovery Programs
Food recovery programs collect foods from commercial production and distribution
channels and redistribute them to people in need. There are food recovery efforts
carried out by public, private, and nonprofit organizations across the country. The
primary goal of food recovery programs is to collect safe and wholesome food donated
from commercial sources to meet the nutritional needs of the hungry.
With bipartisan support, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food
Donation Act in 1996. The Act is designed to encourage the donation of food and
grocery products to nonprofit organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens,
and churches for distribution to hungry individuals. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan
Food Donation Act promotes food recovery by limiting the liability of donors to instances
of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.
Annex 2 – References
321
 








The Guidelines are intended to provide guidance to those who want to participate in
food recovery programs as donors and receiving operations as well as to those who
oversee standards compliance as regulators or peer inspectors.
The Guidelines also give advice on implementing a food recovery program, various
ways to contribute to food recovery programs, choosing suitable partners, and laying
the foundation for a successful program. This includes food safety provisions in
alignment with the FDA Food Code, guidelines for monitoring food recovery programs,
and handling of donations of game animals. For simple recordkeeping, the Guidelines
contain sample forms designed to facilitate the management of a variety of aspects of
food recovery programs.

N. Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual: Storage and Handling of
Tomatoes, 2007.
This document can be found at the web site:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat
oryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113843.htm
The Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual, Storage and Handling of
Tomatoes provides safe storage and handling practices for cut tomatoes and additional
rationale for including cut tomatoes in the definition of time/temperature control for
safety food in the 2005 Food Code. Historically, uncooked fruits and vegetables have
been considered non-TCS food unless they were epidemiologically implicated in
foodborne illness outbreaks and are capable of supporting the growth of pathogenic
bacteria in the absence of temperature control. Since 1990, at least 12 multi-state
foodborne illness outbreaks have been associated with different varieties of tomatoes.
From 1998 – 2006, outbreaks associated with tomatoes made up 17% of the producerelated outbreaks reported to FDA. Salmonella has been the pathogen of concern most
often associated with tomato outbreaks. Recommendations are being offered to
prevent contamination in food service facilities and retail food stores and to reduce the
growth of pathogenic bacteria when contamination of fresh tomatoes may have already
occurred (regardless of the location where the contamination occurred).

O. Retail Food Protection Program Information Manual: Recommendations to Food
Establishments for Serving or Selling Cut Leafy Greens.
This document can be found at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat
oryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113843.htm.
Following 24 multi-state outbreaks between 1998 and 2008, cut leafy greens was
added to the definition of time/temperature for safety food requiring time-temperature
control for safety (TCS). The term used in the definition includes a variety of cut
lettuces and leafy greens. Raw agricultural commodities (RACs) that are not processed
or cut on-site are excluded from the definition of cut leafy greens. Herbs such as
cilantro or parsley are also not considered cut leafy greens. The pH, water activity,
available moisture and nutrients of cut leafy greens supports the growth of foodborne
pathogens and refrigeration at 41ºF (5ºC) or less inhibits growth and promotes general
die off in some pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and
Listeria monocytogenes, once attached to the surface or internalized into cut surfaces
of leafy greens, are only marginally affected by chemical sanitizers. Recommended
handling instructions for leafy greens during purchasing and receiving, storage, food
employee handling fresh produce, washing fresh produce, preparation for sale or
service and display for sale or service are attached to the document.
P. Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook
This document can be found at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat
oryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113827.htm.
The Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook was developed to
encourage practices and behaviors that can help prevent food employees from
spreading foodborne pathogens to food. Information is provided in a question-andanswer format and includes easy references to forms and tables that food service and
retail food establishments and the public health community may find useful when
training staff and addressing employee health and hygiene matters. This handbook
highlights a combination of three interventions that can be effective in prevention of the
transmission of foodborne viruses and bacteria in food establishments. These
interventions include: (a) restricting or excluding ill food employees from working with
food; (b) using proper handwashing procedures; and (c) eliminating bare hand contact
with foods that are ready-to-eat (RTE). Concurrent use of each intervention will help
prevent the transmission of viruses, bacteria and protozoan oocysts from food
employees to consumers through contaminated food. Note that the
recommendations provided are not to be construed as medical advice or
directions to diagnose a medical condition.

The person in charge and the food employee always have the option to seek
professional medical attention as warranted by the situation at hand.
Q. Risk Assessment Process and Spreadsheet to Redesignate Food Code Provisions
These documents can be found at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/default.htm.
FDA developed a set of definitions and a qualitative risk assessment process to
redesignate the Food Code provisions and work with the CFP Critical Items Committee
of stakeholders for feedback. It changed “critical” and “non-critical” to risk designations
which include “priority item,” “ priority foundation item” and “core item” to link the
provision to hazards associated with foodborne illness or injury. The method used is
described in “Risk Assessment Process to Redesignate Food Code Provisions”
and the decision-making process recorded in the Excel spreadsheet for transparency.
The risk assessment decision-making process explained in the instructions provides a
science-based rationale for each redesignation. It is internally consistent and
consistent with peer-reviewed publications.
The process considered the general and specific hazards that each provision is
intended to address. An initial risk designation was made based on the definitions for
“priority item,” “ priority foundation item”, and “core item”, to show how directly the
provision eliminated, prevented or reduced to an acceptable level, the hazards
associated with foodborne illness or injury. To further refine the designation, the
virulence or severity of the hazard in the absence of control by this Code provision was
also examined. Contributing factors (contamination factors, proliferating/amplification
factors, survival factors and method of preparation) identified for foodborne outbreaks
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also considered. The
risk designation was then re-evaluated in terms of meeting the definition, characteristics
of the potential hazards, size and/or number of outbreaks caused by the hazard in
conjunction with non-application of this Code provision and the contributing factors.
The final determination was based on the term which most closely defined that
provision, taking into account any weighting due to severity and infectivity of the hazard.
Additional comments and references to explain or support this determination were
included on the spreadsheet.
R. Parameters for Determining Inoculated Pack/Challenge Study Protocols
The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), in
response to questions posed by FDA, developed guidelines for conducting challenge
studies on pathogen inhibition and inactivation studies in a variety of foods. The
guidelines are available at:

is focused on, and limited to, bacterial inactivation and growth inhibition and does not
make specific recommendations with respect to public health. NACMCF concluded that
challenge studies should be designed considering the most current advances in
methodologies, current thinking on pathogens of concern, and an understanding of the
product preparation, variability and storage conditions. Studies should be completed
and evaluated under the guidance of an expert microbiologist in a qualified laboratory
and should include appropriate statistical design and data analyses.
This document provides guidelines for choice of microorganisms for studies, inoculum
preparation, inoculum level, methods of inoculation, incubation temperatures and times,
sampling considerations, and interpreting test results. Examples of appropriately
designed growth inhibition and inactivation studies are provided. The NACMCF report,
through tables and appendices, also provides sources of accepted laboratory methods,
considerations for selecting a laboratory, pathogens of concern with control methods for
food product categories, relevant Food Code definitions and food product checklists
that test the protocol. It also includes recommended minimum expertise for designing,
conducting and evaluating microbiological studies; potential pathogens of concern for
growth studies based on pH and aw; examples of mathematical growth and inactivation
models and their application to different foods; pathogen growth ranges used in
CommBase and Pathogen Modeling Program models; and limits for growth when other
conditions are near optimum.

T. CIFOR Foodborne Illness Response Guidelines for Owners, Operators, and
Managers of Food Establishments (CIFOR Industry Guidelines)
In 2009, the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR) convened a
workgroup comprised of representatives from the food industry and local, state and
Federal government for the purpose of creating guidelines and tools specific
for industry response to foodborne illness. The resulting document, called the CIFOR
Foodborne Illness Response Guidelines for Owners, Operators, and Managers of Food
Establishments (CIFOR Industry Guidelines), was developed as voluntary guidance for
managers of Food Establishments (“Industry”) to help outline, clarify, and explain
Industry’s recommended role in a foodborne illness outbreak investigation. These
CIFOR Industry Guidelines:
•	 Provide a step-by-step approach including Preparation, Illness Complaints,
Investigation, Control, and Follow-up
•	 Describe what to expect when first notified of potential illnesses or outbreak
•	 Provide Tools to guide Industry through the regulatory investigation process.

Applicability and
Terms Defined
1-201.10 Statement of Application and Listing of
Terms.
(B) Terms Defined
The individual definitions in Chapter 1 are not numbered, consistent with current
conventions regarding the use of plain language in drafting rules, and with use in
national and international standards and some Federal regulations. This facilitates
making changes to the definitions as they become necessary in subsequent editions of
the Food Code. The intent of the definitions to be binding in terms of the application
and interpretation of the Code is clearly stated in Chapter 1.
Accredited Program.
Refer to the definition for Accredited Program in ¶1-201.10 (B)(3).
Food protection manager certification occurs when individuals demonstrate through a
certification program that they have met specified food safety knowledge standards.
Food protection certification program accreditation occurs when certification
organizations demonstrate through an accreditation program that they have met
specified program standards.
Accreditation is a conformity assessment process through which organizations that
certify individuals may voluntarily seek independent evaluation and listing by an
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

accrediting agency based upon the certifying organization=s meeting program
accreditation standards. Such accreditation standards typically relate to such factors as
the certifying organization's structure, mission, policies, procedures, and the
defensibility of its examination processes. These standards are intended to affirm or
enhance the quality and credibility of the certification process, minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest, ensure fairness to candidates for certification and others, and
thereby increase public health protection.
Program accreditation standards known to be relevant to food protection manager
certification programs include those contained in the Standards for Accreditation of
Food Protection Manager Certification Programs available from the Conference for
Food Protection, 2792 Miramar Lane, Lincoln, CA 95648 and found at
http://www.foodprotect.org/
Allowing food protection managers to demonstrate their required food safety knowledge
"through passing a test that is part of an accredited program" is predicated on the fact
that their credentials have been issued by certifying organizations that have
demonstrated conformance with rigorous and nationally recognized program standards.
Egg.
The definition of egg includes avian species’ shell eggs known to be commercially
marketed in the United States. Also included are the eggs of quail and ratites such as
ostrich.
Not included are baluts. Baluts are considered a delicacy among Philippine and
Vietnamese populations. They are derived from fertile eggs, typically duck eggs,
subjected to incubation temperatures for a period of time less than necessary for the
embryo to hatch resulting in a partially formed embryo within the shell. Under the Egg
Products Inspection Act (EPIA), an egg is typically considered adulterated if it has been
subjected to incubation. However, in 9 CFR 590.5, baluts are specifically exempted
from inspection as eggs under the EPIA.
In producing baluts, fertile duck eggs are incubated for approximately 18 days at a
temperature of 42.5°C (108.5°F) in incubators with a relatively high humidity.
(Complete development and hatching would take place in 28 days.) Under these
conditions, the potential for growth of transovarian Salmonella organisms such as S.
Enteritidis within the shell, and the potential for an increase in pathogenic microflora on
the shell itself, are increased. Where chicken eggs are used in preparing baluts, the
incubation period may only be 14 days at an incubation temperature of 37°C (99°F). A
balut is a time/temperature control for safety food subject to time/temperature
management including proper cooking and hot and cold holding. Baluts are typically
boiled and packed in salt before sale or service.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
332
 








Also, not included in this definition are the eggs of reptile species such as alligators and
turtles. Alligator eggs are available for sale in some parts of the southern United
States. In restaurants, the menu item “Alligator Eggs” is sometimes made of alligator
egg, but other times is simply a fanciful name for a menu item that may include seafood
items such as shrimp, but contains no alligator egg.
Sea turtle eggs have been consumed in Asian and Latin American Countries.
However, turtle eggs are not mentioned in the definitions section because sea turtles
(Loggerhead, East Pacific Green, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Kemp’s Ridley, and Olive
Ridley) are protected by The Endangered Species Act of 1973 and therefore may not
be sold or consumed. This Act, with respect to turtle eggs, is enforced by the United
States Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC.
Food establishment and food processing plant.
Food Establishment and a food processing plant located within the same
premises of a food establishment
Some food businesses perform operations that provide food directly to consumers as a
“Food Establishment,” and also supply food to other business entities as a “Food
Processing Plant.” Within such a business, those operations that provide food directly
to consumers only should be considered part of a “Food Establishment” for the
purposes of applying the Food Code while those operations that supply food to other
business entities may be subject to other rules and regulations that apply to “Food
Processing Plants”. It is essential that the permit holder and persons in charge be
aware that regulatory requirements and the appropriate operational practices for “Food
Establishments” may differ from those for “Food Processing Plants.”
Some facilities and functions may be subject to different regulatory requirements
depending on whether that facility or function is regulated as a “Food Establishment” or
as a “Food Processing Plant”, or both. Those facilities and functions within a business
that are shared by both the “Food Establishment” and “Food Processing Plant”
operations, e.g., refrigeration units, dressing room and toilet facilities, food equipment,
water and waste systems, pest control, might be subject to similar regulatory
requirements. The Food Code is intended to apply to “food establishments”.
Packaged.
The definition of “packaged” was revised in (2) to clarify when foods packaged at retail
need not be labeled.
Refer to Public Health Reasons for Food Labels §3-602.11.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
333
 






Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food
Time Temperature Control for Safety Food (TCS) is defined in terms of whether or not it
requires time/temperature control for safety to limit pathogen growth or toxin formation.
The term does not include foods that do not support growth but may contain a
pathogenic microorganism or chemical or physical food safety hazard at a level
sufficient to cause foodborne illness or injury. The progressive growth of all foodborne
pathogens is considered whether slow or rapid.
The definition of TCS food takes into consideration pH, aw, pH and aw interaction, heat
treatment, and packaging for a relatively simple determination of whether the food
requires time/temperature control for safety. If the food is heat-treated to eliminate
vegetative cells, it needs to be addressed differently than a raw product with no, or
inadequate, heat treatment. In addition, if the food is packaged after heat treatment to
destroy vegetative cells and subsequently packaged to prevent re-contamination, higher
ranges of pH and/or aw can be tolerated because remaining spore-forming bacteria are
the only microbial hazards of concern. While foods will need to be cooled slightly to
prevent condensation inside the package, they must be protected from contamination in
an area with limited access and packaged before temperatures drop below 57°C
(135°F). In some foods, it is possible that neither the pH value nor the aw value is low
enough by itself to control or eliminate pathogen growth; however, the interaction of pH
and aw may be able to accomplish it. This is an example of a hurdle technology.
Hurdle technology involves several inhibitory factors being used together to control or
eliminate pathogen growth, when they would otherwise be ineffective if used alone.
When no other inhibitory factors are present and the pH and/or aw values are unable to
control or eliminate bacterial pathogens which may be present, growth may occur and
foodborne outbreaks result. Cut melons, cut tomatoes, and cut leafy greens are
examples where intrinsic factors are unable to control bacterial growth once pathogens
are exposed to the cellular fluids and nutrients after cutting.
In determining if time/temperature control is required, combination products present
their own challenge. A combination product is one in which there are two or more
distinct food components and an interface between the two components may have a
different property than either of the individual components. A determination must be
made about whether the food has distinct components such as pie with meringue
topping, focaccia bread, meat salads, or fettuccine alfredo with chicken or whether it
has a uniform consistency such as gravies, puddings, or sauces. In these products, the
pH at the interface is important in determining if the item is a TCS food.
A well designed inoculation study or other published scientific research should be used
to determine whether a food can be held without time/temperature control when:
•	 process technologies other than heat are applied to destroy foodborne
pathogens (e.g., irradiation, high pressure processing, pulsed light, ozonation);
•	 combination products are prepared; or
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
334
 






•	 other extrinsic factors (e.g., packaging/atmospheres) or intrinsic factors (e.g.,
redox potential, salt content, antimicrobials) are used to control or eliminate
pathogen growth.
Before using Tables A and B in paragraph 1-201.10(B) of the definition for
“time/temperature control for safety food” in determining whether a food requires
time/temperature control for safety (TCS), answers to the following questions should be
considered:
•	 Is the intent to hold the food without using time or temperature control?
o	 If the answer is No, no further action is required. The decision tree later in
this Annex is not needed to determine if the item is a TCS food.
•	 Is the food raw, or is the food heat-treated?
•	 Does the food already require time/temperature control for safety by definition in
paragraph 1-201.10(B)?
•	 Does a product history with sound scientific rationale exist indicating a safe
history of use?
•	 Is the food processed and packaged so that it no longer requires TCS such as
ultra high temperature (UHT) creamers or shelf-stable canned goods?
•	 What is the pH and aw of the food in question using an independent laboratory
and Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods of analysis?
A food designated as product assessment required (PA), in either table should be
considered TCS Food until further study proves otherwise. The PA means that based
on the food’s pH and aw and whether it was raw or heat-treated or packaged, it has to
be considered TCS until inoculation studies or some other acceptable evidence shows
that the food is a TCS food or not. The Food Code requires a variance request to the
regulatory authority with the evidence that the food does not require time/temperature
control for safety.
The Food Code definition designates certain raw plant foods as TCS food because they
have been shown to support the growth of foodborne pathogens in the absence of
temperature control and to lack intrinsic factors that would inhibit pathogen growth.
Unless product assessment shows otherwise, these designations are supported by
Tables A and B. For example:
For cut cantaloupe (pH 6.2-7.1, aw > 0.99, not heat-treated),. fresh sprouts (pH > 6.5,
aw > 0.99, not heat-treated), and cut tomatoes (pH 4.23 – 5.04, aw > 0.99, not heattreated), Table B indicates that they are considered TCS Foods unless a product
assessment shows otherwise. Maintaining these products under the temperature
control requirements prescribed in this code for TCS food will limit the growth of
pathogens that may be present in or on the food and may help prevent foodborne
illness.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
335
 


















If a facility adjusts the pH of a food using vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid for
purposes other than flavor enhancement, a variance is required under ¶ 3-502.11(C). A
HACCP plan is required whether the food is a TCS food as in subparagraph 3-502.11
(C)(1) or not a TCS food, as in subparagraph 3-502.11(C)(2). A standardized recipe
validated by lab testing for pH and aw would be an appropriate part of the variance
request with annual (or other frequency as specified by the regulatory authority)
samples tested to verify compliance with the conditions of the variance.

“Evaluation and Definition of Potentially Hazardous Foods” at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm0
94141.htm
Instructions for using the following Decision Tree and Table A and Table B:
1. Does the operator want to hold the food without using time or temperature control?
a.	 No – Continue holding the food at ≤5°C(41°F) or ≥57°C(135°F) for safety
and/or quality.
b. Yes – Continue using the decision tree to identify which table to use to
determine whether time/temperature control for safety (TCS) is required.
2. Is the food heat-treated?
a.	 No – The food is either raw, partially cooked (not cooked to the temperature
specified in section 3-401.11 of the Food Code) or treated with some other
method other than heat. Proceed to step #3.
b. Yes – If the food is heat-treated to the required temperature for that food as
specified under section 3-401.11 of the Food Code, vegetative cells will be
destroyed although spores will survive. Proceed to step #4.
3. Is the food treated using some other method?
a.	 No –The food is raw or has only received a partial cook allowing vegetative
cells and spores to survive. Proceed to step #6.
b. Yes – If a method other than heat is used to destroy pathogens such as
irradiation, high pressure processing, pulsed light, ultrasound, inductive
heating, or ozonation, the effectiveness of the process needs to be validated
by inoculation studies or other means. Proceed to step #5.
4. Is it packaged to prevent re-contamination?
a.	 No – Re-contamination of the product can occur after heat treatment because
it is not packaged. Proceed to step #6.
b. Yes – If the food is packaged immediately after heat treatment to prevent recontamination, higher ranges of pH and/or aw can be tolerated because
spore-forming bacteria are the only microbial hazard. Proceed to step #7.
5. Further product assessment or vendor documentation required.
a.	 The vendor of this product may be able to supply documentation that
inoculation studies indicate the food can be safely held without
time/temperature control for safety.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
336
 








b. Food prepared or processed using new technologies may be held without
time/temperature control provided the effectiveness of the use of such
technologies is based on a validated inoculation study.
6. Using the food’s known pH and/or aw values, position the food in the appropriate
table.
a.	 Choose the column under “pH values” that contains the pH value of the food
in question.
b. Choose the row under “awvalues” that contains the aw value of the food in
question.
c.	 Note where the row and column intersect to identify whether the food is “nonTCS food” and therefore does not require time/temperature control, or
whether further product assessment (PA) is required. Other factors such as
redox potential, competitive microorganisms, salt content, or processing
methods may allow the product to be held without time/temperature control
but an inoculation study is required.
7. Use Table A for foods that are heat-treated and packaged OR use Table B for
foods that are not heat-treated or heat-treated but not packaged.
8. Determine if the item is non-TCS or needs further product assessment (PA).

Chapter 2 Management and Personnel
Responsibility 2-101.11 Assignment.
Designation of a person in charge during all hours of operations ensures the continuous
presence of someone who is responsible for monitoring and managing all food
establishment operations and who is authorized to take actions to ensure that the
Code's objectives are fulfilled. During the day-to-day operation of a food establishment,
a person who is immediately available and knowledgeable in both operational and Code
requirements is needed to respond to questions and concerns and to resolve problems.
In cases where a food establishment has several departments on the premises (e.g., a
grocery store with deli, seafood, and produce departments) and the regulatory authority
has permitted those departments individually as separate food establishments, it may
be unnecessary from a food safety standpoint to staff each department with a separate
Person in Charge during periods when food is not being prepared, packaged or served.
While activities such as moving food products from a refrigerated display case to the
walk-in refrigerator, cleaning the floors, or doing inventory when the department is not
busy, do take place during these times, a designated Person in Charge for multiple
departments or the entire facility can oversee these operations and be ready to take
corrective actions if necessary.
Knowledge 2-102.11 Demonstration.
The designated person in charge who is knowledgeable about foodborne disease
prevention, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles, and Code
requirements is prepared to recognize conditions that may contribute to foodborne
illness or that otherwise fail to comply with Code requirements, and to take appropriate
preventive and corrective actions.
There are many ways in which the person in charge can demonstrate competency.
Many aspects of the food operation itself will reflect the competency of that person. A
dialogue with the person in charge during the inspection process will also reveal
whether or not that person is enabled by a clear understanding of the Code and its
public health principles to follow sound food safety practices and to produce foods that
are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and accurately represented.
The Food Code does not require reporting of uninfected cuts or reporting of covered,
protected infected cuts/lesions/boils since no bare hand contact with ready-to-eat (RTE)
food is a Code requirement.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
340
 





2-102.12 Certified Food Protection Manager
The increasing complexity of the food industry, the improved ability to identify/trace
foodborne outbreaks and other economic, staffing, cultural and behavioral challenges
make it imperative that food protection managers know and control the risk factors that
impact the safety of the food they sell or serve. Food protection managers have an
important role in formulating policies, verifying food employees carry out these policies,
and communicating with these same employees to give information about
recommended practices to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. A Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Environmental Health Specialist-Network (EHS-Net) study
suggests that the presence of a certified food protection manager reduces the risk for a
foodborne outbreak for an establishment and was a distinguishing factor between
restaurants that experienced a foodborne illness outbreak and those that had not.
FDA's Retail Food Risk Factor Studies suggest that the presence of a certified manager
has a positive correlation with more effective control of certain risk factors, such as poor
personal hygiene, in different facility types.
There are a number of state and local agencies that currently mandate food protection
manager certification. It is appropriate for State and local agencies, by way of codes
and ordinances or by policy to establish criteria for what types of permitted
establishments could be exempt from the mandatory manager certification requirement
and for determining the conditions under which the minimum number of certified food
protection managers must be some number greater than one.
Factors to consider when establishing such criteria include:
• the size and scope of the operation;
• the hours of operation;,
• the types of foods sold or served;
• the extent to which food is prepared on site;
• the number of staff,
• type of population served, e.g. highly susceptible or not; and
• the number of meals served.
2-102.20 Food Protection Manager Certification.
Many food protection manager certification programs have shared a desire to have the
food manager certificates they issue universally recognized and accepted by others –
especially by the increasing number of regulatory authorities that require food manager
certification.
Needed has been a mechanism for regulatory authorities to use in determining which
certificates should be considered credible based on which certificate issuing programs
meet sound organizational and certification procedures and use defensible processes
in their test development and administration.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

After a multi-year effort involving a diversity of stakeholder groups, the Conference for
Food Protection (CFP) completed work on its Standards for Accreditation of Food
Protection Manager Certification Programs found at:
http://www.foodprotect.org/manager-certification/. In 2002 the Conference entered into
a cooperative agreement with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to
provide independent third-party evaluation and accreditation of certification bodies
determined to be in conformance with these Conference standards. ANSI published its
first listing of accredited certifiers in 2003.
The Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in his address before
the 2004 biennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection, commended this
Conference achievement and encouraged universal acceptance based on the
CFP/ANSI accreditation program.
Distributed at this meeting was the following letter addressed to the Conference Chair
and signed by the Director of FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The
letter puts forth the Agency’s basis for its support of universal acceptance of food
protection manager certifications.
“The 2004 biennial meeting of the Conference for Food Protection is a
fitting occasion for FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to
commend the Conference for its significant achievements in support of
State and local food safety programs.
The FDA in a Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the Conference
for Food Protection as a voluntary national organization qualified to
develop standards to promote food protection. Conference
recommendations contribute to improvements in the model FDA Food
Code and help jurisdictions justify, adopt and implement its provisions.
Conference mechanisms involving active participation by representatives
of diverse stakeholder groups produce consensus standards of the
highest quality. An excellent example is the Conference’s Standards for
Accreditation of Food Protection Manager Certification Programs,
and its announcement of the new on-line listing of accredited certifiers of
industry food protection managers. Many years in their development,
these Conference standards identify the essential components necessary
for a credible certification program. Components cover a wide range of
requirements such as detailed criteria for exam development and
administration, and responsibilities of the certification organization to
candidates and the public.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

FDA applauds the Conference for this significant achievement, and
encourages agencies at all levels of government to accept certificates
issued by listed certifiers as meeting their jurisdictions’ food safety
knowledge and certification requirements. The American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) has independently evaluated these certification
programs under an agreement with the Conference for Food Protection.
Governments and industry widely recognize and respect ANSI as an
accrediting organization. ANSI has found certifiers it lists as accredited
(http://www.ansi.org/) under “conformity assessment” – “personnel
certification accreditation” to conform to the Conference’s Standards for
Accreditation of Food Protection Manager Certification Programs.*
The Food Code states the person in charge of a food establishment is
accountable for developing, carrying out, and enforcing procedures aimed
at preventing food-borne illness. Section 2-102.11 states that one means
by which a person in charge may demonstrate required knowledge of food
safety is through certification as a food protection manager by passing an
examination that is part of an accredited program.**
FDA encourages food regulatory authorities and others evaluating
credentials for food protection managers to recognize the Conference for
Food Protection/ANSI means of accrediting certification programs. This
procedure provides a means for universal acceptance of individuals who
successfully demonstrate knowledge of food safety. The procedure
provides officials assurance that food safety certification is based on valid,
reliable, and legally defensible criteria. In addition, universal acceptance
eliminates the inconvenience and unnecessary expense of repeating
training and testing when managers work across jurisdictional boundaries.
FDA, along with State, local, tribal, and other Federal agencies and the
food industry, share the responsibility for ensuring that our food supply is
safe. It is anticipated that this new Conference for Food Protection/ANSI
program will lead to enhanced consumer protection, improve the overall
level of food safety, and be an important component of a seamless
national food safety system.”

Duties 2-103.11 Person in Charge.
A primary responsibility of the person in charge is to ensure compliance with Code
requirements. Any individual present in areas of a food establishment where food and
food-contact items are exposed presents a potential contamination risk. By controlling
who is allowed in those areas and when visits are scheduled and by assuring that all
authorized persons in the establishment, such as delivery, maintenance and service
personnel, and pest control operators, comply with the Code requirements, the person
in charge establishes an important barrier to food contamination.
Tours of food preparation areas serve educational and promotional purposes; however,
the timing of such visits is critical to food safety. Tours may disrupt standard or routine
operational procedures, and the disruption could lead to unsafe food. By scheduling
tours during nonpeak hours the opportunities for contamination are reduced.
When food and other purchased goods are delivered and placed into designated
locations within the food establishment during non-operating hours, the Person in
Charge must make sure food employees inspect such product and verify that it is from
the appropriate supplier, is in the desired condition, and was delivered to a proper
storage location. Distributors deliver and place food and other goods in refrigeration
units, freezers, and dry storage areas for confirmation of receipt and inspection by
employees immediately upon arrival to the food establishment. Distributors contracted
by the food establishment are often given a key to allow access into the establishment
outside of normal working hours. Upon delivery, all food must be appropriately stored in
a safe and secure manner within the food establishment. For example,
time/temperature control for safety foods must be stored within refrigeration units and
held at temperatures of 41°F or below. Likewise, if the food product is frozen, it must
be placed into the freezer.
To minimize the potential for access to the food establishment and the food by an
unauthorized person, precautions should be applied overall to the food establishment
and especially when access to the facility is made under key access deliveries.

Food allergy is an increasing food safety and public health issue, affecting
approximately 4% of the U.S. population, or twelve million Americans.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
344
 





Restaurant and retail food service managers need to be aware of the serious nature of
food allergies, including allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and death; to know the eight
major food allergens; to understand food allergen ingredient identities and labeling; and
to avoid cross-contact during food preparation and service. The 2008 Conference of
Food Protection (CFP) passed Issue 2008-III-006 which provided that food allergy
awareness should be a food safety training duty of the Person in Charge. Accordingly,
the Person in Charge’s Duties under paragraph (M) were amended to assure the food
safety training of employees includes food allergy awareness in order for them to safely
perform duties related to food allergies.
Paragraph (M) “EMPLOYEES are properly trained in FOOD safety, including food allergy
awareness, as it relates to their assigned duties” allows industry to develop and
implement operational-specific training programs for food employees. It is not intended
to require that all food employees pass a test that is part of an accredited program.
Paragraph (N) emphasizes the important role the Person in Charge (PIC) has in making
sure employees properly report certain information about their health status as it relates
to diseases that are transmitted by food. In an effort to reinforce dialogue between food
employees and the PIC, there must be a way to verify that food employees and
conditional employees are informed of their responsibility to report such information.
Examples of ways to verify that employees have been appropriately informed include:
•	 The ability to provide documentation that all food employees and conditional
employees are informed of their responsibility to report to management, such as
completion of Form 1-B, “Conditional Employees or Food Employees Reporting
Agreement” in Annex 7 or other similar state or local forms containing the same
information;
•	 Presenting evidence such as curriculum and attendance rosters documenting
that each employee has completed a training program which includes all the
information required for reporting in Form 1-B;
•	 Implementation of an employee health policy that includes a system of employee
notification using a combination of training, signs, pocket cards or other means
to convey all the required information (Refer to Annex 3, 2-201 Infected Food
Employees and Conditional Employees Practical Applications of Using Subpart
2-201, for further guidance);
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
345
 

•	 Other methods that satisfactorily demonstrate that all food employees and
conditional employees are informed of their responsibility to report to the PIC
information about their health and activities as it relates to diseases that are
transmissible through food, as specified under ¶2-201.11 (A)
In various places throughout the Code, it is specified that either written operating
procedures or operational plans be developed. The link between management
responsibility for developing and implementing the procedures or plans is now
established as a new duty for the Person in Charge (PIC). This new provision does not
establish new requirements in the development of plans or procedures; rather it
emphasizes the importance of the role the PIC plays in ensuring active managerial
control of the food establishment with the development and implementation of plans
and/or procedures as specified in this Code. Examples of Code provisions that call for
the development of plans or procedures can be found in: §2-501.11, ¶¶3-301.11(D) and
3-401.14 (F), §§ 3-501.19, and 5-205.14. Ultimately, responsibility for food safety at the
retail level lies with retail and food service operators and their ability to develop and
maintain effective food safety management systems. There are many tools that
industry can use to develop an effective system to achieve active managerial control of
foodborne illness risk factors. An important tool in controlling risk factors inherent in a
food establishment is the development and implementation of written procedures or
plans.
(Also refer to Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices (1) (D) for further
information).
2-2 Employee Health
Overall goals
The purpose of this section of the Food Code is to reduce the likelihood that certain
viral and bacterial agents will be transmitted from infected food employees into food.
The agents of concern are known to be readily transmissible via food that has been
contaminated by ill food employees, and so for that reason, are the primary focus of the
Employee Health section of the Food Code. However, there are different levels of risk
associated with different levels of clinical illness. The structure of the restrictions and
exclusions has, therefore, been designed in a tiered fashion depending on the clinical
situation to offer the maximum protection to public health with the minimal disruption to
employees and employers.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
346
 









Four levels of illness or potential illness have been identified with the first level being
the highest potential risk to public health and the fourth level being the lowest. The first
level relates to employees who have specific symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea,
jaundice) while in the workplace. These symptoms are known to be associated
commonly with the agents most likely to be transmitted from infected food employees
through contamination of food. The first level also relates to employees who have been
diagnosed with typhoid fever or an infection with hepatitis A virus (within 14 days of
symptoms). The second level relates to employees who have been diagnosed with the
specific agents that are of concern, but who are not exhibiting symptoms of disease
because their symptoms have resolved. The third level relates to employees who are
diagnosed with the specific agents, but never develop any gastrointestinal symptoms.
The fourth level relates to those individuals who are clinically well but who may have
been exposed to a listed pathogen and are within the normal incubation period of
disease.
The most significant degree of restriction and exclusion applies to the first level of food
employee illness. Infected food employees in the first level are likely to be excreting
high levels of their infectious pathogen, increasing the chance of transmission to food
products, and thus on to those consuming the food. The first level includes food
employees who are:
•	 Experiencing active symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting – with no diagnosis,
•	 Experiencing jaundice within the last 7 days-- with no diagnosis,
•	 Diagnosed with typhoid fever,
•	 Diagnosed with hepatitis A within 7 days of jaundice or 14 days of any

symptoms, or

•	 Experiencing active symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting, and diagnosed with
Norovirus, E. coli O157:H7 or other Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli
(STEC), Shigella spp. infection, or nontyphoidal Salmonella.
Diagnosis with typhoid fever or hepatitis A virus is included in level 1 because
employees diagnosed with these pathogens are likely to be shedding high levels of the
pathogen in their stool without exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms. Peak levels of
hepatitis A viral shedding in the feces typically occurs before symptoms appear.
Diarrhea and vomiting are reliable indicators of infection with Norovirus, E. coli
O157:H7 or other STEC, and Shigella spp., but are not typical symptoms of typhoid
fever or hepatitis A. For example, employees diagnosed with typhoid fever are more
likely to experience constipation, rather than diarrhea. Jaundice is also not always
reliable as an indicator of a hepatitis A infection because employees can be infected
with hepatitis A virus without experiencing jaundice (anicteric employees). Dark urine
and light colored stool may be an indicator of a hepatitis A infection but may go
unreported.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
347
 










Maximum protection to public health requires excluding food employees suffering from
typhoid fever, hepatitis A virus, or specific gastrointestinal symptoms associated with
diseases identified as likely to be transmitted through contamination of food (See
section 2-201.12, Tables 2-201.12 #1a and #1b in this Annex). This situation describes
the highest level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food, or what we would find in the
first level.
Food employees who have been diagnosed with one of the agents of concern, but are
not symptomatic because their symptoms have resolved, are still likely to be carrying
the infected agent in their intestinal tract. This makes such employees less likely to
spread the agent into food than others who are actually symptomatic, but employees
diagnosed with one of the agents of concern still pose an elevated threat to public
health. For this reason, there are a series of exclusions (if the employees work in
facilities serving highly susceptible populations (HSP)) and restrictions (for non-HSP
facilities) depending on the agent involved (See section 2-201.12, Table #2). This
situation describes the second level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food.
Diagnosed, asymptomatic food employees who never develop symptoms are typically
identified during a foodborne illness outbreak investigation through microbiological
testing. If infected and asymptomatic employees are not microbiologically tested, they
will remain undetected and could therefore extend the duration of a foodborne illness
outbreak through continued contamination of food. The Food Code provides restriction
or exclusion guidelines for employees that are identified through microbiological testing
with an infection from a listed foodborne pathogen, but are otherwise asymptomatic and
clinically well (See section 2-201.12, Table #3). The exclusion or restriction guidelines
are applied until the identified food employees no longer present a risk for foodborne
pathogen transmission. This situation describes the third level of risk in transmitting
pathogens to food.
Some food employees or conditional employees may report a possible exposure to an
agent. For example, a food employee may have attended a function at which the food
employee ate food that was associated with an outbreak of shigellosis, but the
employee remains well. Such individuals fall into the category of having had a potential
exposure and present a lower risk to public health than someone who is either
symptomatic or who has a definitive diagnosis. They present a level of risk to public
health that is greater than if they had not had the exposure. The approach taken in the
Food Code to food employees who have had a potential exposure is based on the
incubation times (time between exposure and the onset of symptoms) of the various
agents. The times chosen for restriction are the upper end of the average incubation
periods for the specific agents. The Food Code provides restriction guidelines for food
employees working in facilities serving a HSP. The reasoning is that this will restrict food
employees only up to the time when it is unlikely they will develop symptoms. As a
further protection to public health, it is recommended that such exposed food
employees working in facilities not serving a HSP pay particular attention to personal
hygiene and report the onset of any symptoms (See section 2-201.12, Table #4). This
situation describes the fourth level of risk in transmitting pathogens to food.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
348
 







This structured approach has linked the degree of exclusion and restriction to the
degree of risk that an infected food employee will transmit an agent of concern into
food. The approach strikes a balance between protecting public health and the needs
of the food employee and employer.
The Food Code provisions related to employee health are aimed at removing highly
infectious food employees from the work place. They were developed with recognition
of the characteristics of the six important pathogens, and of the risk of disease
transmission associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic shedders. The provisions
also account for the increased risk associated with serving food to HSP’s and the need
to provide extra protection to those populations.
The Employee Health section was developed and revised with assistance and input
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The exclusion and restriction criteria
are based on communicable disease information, as required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, in the list of Pathogens Transmitted by Food Contaminated by
Infected Persons Who Handle Food, and Modes of Transmission of Such Pathogens
posted on CDC’s website, and from the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual,
19th Ed., David L. Heymann, MD, Editor, by the American Public Health Association,
Washington D.C., 2008.
2-201 Infected Food Employees and Conditional
Employees Practical Applications of Using
Subpart 2-201
The information provided in Subpart 2-201 is designed to assist food establishment
managers and regulatory officials in removing infected food employees when they are
at greatest risk of transmitting foodborne pathogens to food. Practical applications of
the information in Subpart 2-201 by a food establishment manager may involve using
Subpart 2-201 as a basis for obtaining information on the health status of food
employees and can also be used as a basis in developing and implementing an
effective Employee Health Policy. Regulatory officials can benefit by using the
information provided below as a basis for determining compliance with Subpart 2-201
during a facility food safety inspection.
The development and effective implementation of an employee health policy based on
the provisions in Subpart 2-201 may help to prevent foodborne illness associated with
contamination of food by ill or infected food employees. The person in charge and food
employees should be familiar with and able to provide the following information through
direct dialogue or other means when interviewed by facility managers or regulatory
officials. Compliance must be based, however, on first hand observations or
information and cannot be based solely on responses from the person in charge to
questions regarding hypothetical situations or knowledge of the Food Code. Also, when
designing and implementing an employee health policy, the following information should
be considered and addressed:
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
349
 




1. Does the establishment have an Employee Health Policy? If so, are the food
employees aware of the employee health policy, and is it available in written
format and readily available for food employees? (Note: A written Employee
Health Policy is not a Food Code requirement unless the facility is operating
under a pre-approved alternative procedure specified under ¶3-301.11(E)).
2. Does the establishment require conditional employees and food employees to
report certain illnesses, conditions, symptoms, and exposures?
3. Are the reporting requirements explained to all employees?
4. What are the reporting requirements for conditional employees, food employees,
and the food establishment manager?
5. Are conditional employees asked if they are experiencing certain symptoms or
illnesses upon offer of employment? If so, which symptoms or illnesses?
6. If a food employee reports a diagnosis with one of the 6 listed pathogens in the
Food Code, what questions are asked of the food employee? (The first question
every food manager should ask a food employee who reports diagnosis with a
listed pathogen is if the employee is currently having any symptoms.)
7. Who does the establishment notify when a food employee reports a diagnosis
with one of the listed pathogens?
8. What gastrointestinal symptoms would require exclusion of a food employee
from the food establishment?
9. What history of exposure is a conditional employee or food employee required to
report?
10.If a food employee reports a gastrointestinal symptom, what criteria are used to
allow the employee to return to work?

Diagnosis
2-201.11 Responsibility of the Person in Charge, Food
Employees, and Conditional Employees.
Proper management of a food establishment operation begins with employing healthy
people and instituting a system of identifying employees who present a risk of
transmitting foodborne pathogens to food or to other employees. The person in charge
is responsible for ensuring all food employees and conditional employees are
knowledgeable and understand their responsibility to report listed symptoms, diagnosis
with an illness from a listed pathogen, or exposure to a listed pathogen to the person in
charge. The person in charge is also responsible for reporting to the regulatory official
if a food employee reports a diagnosis with a listed pathogen.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
350
 












This reporting requirement is an important component of any food safety program. A
food employee who suffers from any of the illnesses or medical symptoms or has a
history of exposure to a listed pathogen in this Code may transmit disease through the
food being prepared. The person in charge must first be aware that a food employee or
conditional employee is suffering from a disease or symptom listed in the Code before
steps can be taken to reduce the chance of foodborne illness.
The person in charge may observe some of the symptoms that must be reported.
However, food employees and conditional employees share a responsibility for
preventing foodborne illness and are obligated to inform the person in charge if they are
suffering from any of the listed symptoms, have a history of exposure to one of the
listed pathogens, or have been diagnosed with an illness caused by a listed pathogen.
Food employees must comply with restrictions or exclusions imposed upon them.
A conditional employee is a potential food employee to whom a job offer has been
made, conditional on responses to subsequent medical questions or examinations.
The questions or examinations are designed to identify potential food employees who
may be suffering from a disease that can be transmitted through food and done in
compliance with Title 1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A conditional
employee becomes a food employee as soon as the employee begins working, even if
only on a restricted basis. When a conditional employee reports a listed diagnosis or
symptom, the person in charge is responsible for ensuring that the conditional
employee is prohibited from becoming a food employee until the criteria for
reinstatement of an exclusion are met (as specified under section 2-201.13 of the Food
Code). When a symptomatic or diagnosed conditional employee has met the same
criteria for reinstatement that apply to an excluded symptomatic or diagnosed food
employee (as specified under section 2-201.13 of the Food Code), the conditional
employee may then begin working as a food employee.
Reporting Symptoms:
In order to protect the health of consumers and employees, information concerning the
health status of conditional employees and food employees must be disclosed to the
person in charge. The symptoms listed in the Code cover the common symptoms
experienced by persons suffering from the pathogens identified by CDC as
transmissible through food by infected food employees. A food employee suffering from
any of the symptoms listed presents an increased risk of transmitting foodborne illness.
The symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, or jaundice serve as an indication that an
individual may be infected with a fecal-oral route pathogen, and is likely to be excreting
high levels of the infectious agent. When a food employee is shedding extremely high
numbers of a pathogen through the stool or vomitus, there is greater chance of
transmitting the pathogen to food products.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
351
 





Sore throat with fever serves as an indication that the individual may be infected with
Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus pyogenes causes a common infection
otherwise known as “streptococcal sore throat” or “strep throat.” Streptococcal sore
throat can spread from contaminated hands to food, which has been the source of
explosive streptococcal sore throat outbreaks. Previous foodborne episodes with
streptococcus sore throat have occurred in contaminated milk and egg products. Food
products can be contaminated by infected food employees hands or from nasal
discharges. Untreated individuals in uncomplicated cases can be communicable for
10-21 days, and untreated individuals with purulent discharges may be communicable
for weeks or months.
Lesions containing pus that may occur on a food employee’s hands, as opposed to
such wounds on other parts of the body, represent a direct threat for introducing
Staphylococcus aureus into food. Consequently, a double barrier is required to cover
hand and wrist lesions. Pustular lesions on the arms are less of a concern when usual
food preparation practices are employed and, therefore, a single barrier is allowed.
However, if the food preparation practices entail contact of the exposed portion of the
arm with food, a barrier equivalent to that required for the hands and wrists would be
necessitated. Lesions on other parts of the body need to be covered; but an
impermeable bandage is not considered necessary for food safety purposes. Food
employees should be aware that hands and fingers that contact pustular lesions on
other parts of the body or with the mucous membrane of the nose also pose a direct
threat for introducing Staphylococcus aureus into food.
If a food employee has an infected cut and bandages it and puts on a glove, the
employee does not have to report the infected cut to the person in charge. However, if
the employee does not bandage it, reporting is required.
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits medical
examinations and inquiries as to the existence, nature, or severity of a disability before
extending a conditional offer of employment. In order for the permit holder and the
person in charge to be in compliance with this particular aspect of the Code and the
ADA, a conditional job offer must be made before making inquiries about the applicant’s
health status.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
352
 









The ADA also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation to qualified
applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change
in the application process, in the way a job is done, or to other parts of the job that
enables a person with a disability to have equal employment opportunities. ADA
disabilities are serious, long-term conditions. Most people with diseases resulting from
the pathogens listed in the Food Code do not have ADA disabilities because these
diseases are usually short-term in duration. In addition, the gastrointestinal symptoms
listed in the Food Code usually are not long-term and severe enough, in themselves, to
be ADA disabilities. Of course, these symptoms may be linked to other conditions that
may be serious enough to be ADA disabilities, like Crohn’s disease or cancer.
A food employer may exclude any employee under the Food Code upon initially
learning that the employee has Salmonella Typhi, or has a gastrointestinal symptom
listed in the Food Code. The excluded employee may then ask for an ADA reasonable
accommodation instead of the exclusion. In response, the employer’s first step should
be to ask the employee to establish that the employee is disabled by the disease or
symptom (or that the symptom is caused by another ADA disability). If the employee
successfully proves that the employee has an ADA disability, then the employer may
continue to exclude the employee under the Food Code if:
•	 there is no reasonable accommodation at work that would eliminate the
risk of transmitting the disease while also allowing the employee to work in
a food handling position, or
•	 all reasonable accommodations would pose an undue hardship on the
employer’s business; and
•	 there is no vacant position not involving food handling for which the
employee is qualified and to which the employee can be reassigned.
Example 1: A food employee working in the café of a department store informs the
employer that the employee has been diagnosed with a disease caused by Salmonella
Typhi. The employer immediately excludes the employee under the requirements of
the Food Code. The employee then establishes that the disease is an ADA disability
because it is severe and long-term and the employee requests reasonable
accommodation instead of an exclusion. The employer determines that no reasonable
accommodation would eliminate the risk of transmitting Salmonella Typhi through food
and refuses to remove the exclusion. However, there is a vacant clerical position in
another part of the store for which the employee is qualified. Unless the employer can
establish that reassigning the employee to this position would be an undue hardship,
the employer’s failure to make the reassignment instead of continuing the exclusion
would be a violation of the ADA.1
1 Whether or not the employee in question is an individual with an ADA disability, in those jurisdictions where the
Code is adopted, Food Code exclusions or restrictions must be removed when requirements for removal under
§ 2-201.13 of the Code are met.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
353
 






Example 2: A food employee has diarrhea and is excluded. The employee establishes
that the diarrhea is caused by Crohn’s disease. This employee also establishes a
serious longstanding history of Crohn’s disease and is an individual with an ADA
disability. Crohn’s disease is not a communicable disease and cannot be transmitted
through food. No reasonable accommodation is needed to eliminate the risk of
transmitting the disease through the food supply, so the Food Code exclusion should
be removed. Of course, the Food Code’s provisions on personal cleanliness for hands
and arms apply as usual, requiring employees to clean hands and exposed portions of
arms after using the toilet room and in other specified circumstances (Subpart 2-301).
Somewhat different rules apply to conditional employees. If a conditional employee
reports a disease or symptom listed in the Food Code and shows that the disease or
symptom makes the conditional employee an individual with an ADA disability, the
employer may withdraw the job offer only if:
•	 The job involves food handling; and
•	 The employer determines that either there is no reasonable
accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease
through food, or any such accommodation would be an undue hardship to
the business.
•	 There is no need to offer the conditional employee a vacant position not
involving food handling as a reasonable accommodation.
It should be noted that the information provided here about the ADA is intended to alert
employers to the existence of ADA and related CFR requirements. For a
comprehensive understanding of the ADA and its implications, consult the references
listed in Annex 2 that relate to this section of the Code or contact the U. S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. See the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission’s How to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act: A Guide for
Restaurants and Other Food Service Employers, found at
http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide.html or
http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/restaurant_guide_summary.html for detailed information
about the interaction between the FDA Food Code and the ADA.
The information required from applicants and food employees is designed to identify
employees who may be suffering from a disease that can be transmitted through food.
It is the responsibility of the permit holder to convey to applicants and employees the
importance of notifying the person in charge of changes in their health status. Once
notified, the person in charge can take action to prevent the likelihood of the
transmission of foodborne illness. Applicants, to whom a conditional offer of
employment is extended, and food employees are required to report their specific
history of exposure, medical symptoms, and previous illnesses.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
354
 





The symptoms listed may be indicative of a disease that is transmitted through the food
supply by infected food employees.
Section 103 (d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101–336,
requires the Secretary to publish a list of infectious and communicable diseases that
are transmitted through handling the food supply and to review and update the list
annually. The CDC published on its website in November 2012 a list of Pathogens
Transmitted by Food Contaminated by Infected Persons Who Handle Food, and Modes
of Transmission of Such Pathogens. See the list at http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodsafety-office.html#food
The final list has been reviewed in light of new information and has been revised as set
forth below.
Pathogens Transmitted by Food Contaminated by Infected Persons Who Handle
Food, and Modes of Transmission of Such Pathogens
Some pathogens are frequently transmitted by food contaminated by infected persons.
The presence of any one of the following signs or symptoms in persons who handle
food may indicate infection by a pathogen that could be transmitted to others through
handling the food supply: diarrhea, vomiting, open skin sores, boils, fever, dark urine or
jaundice. The failure of food-handlers to wash hands in certain situations (such as after
using the toilet, handling raw meat, cleaning spills, or carrying garbage), wear clean
gloves, or use clean utensils is responsible for the foodborne transmission of these
pathogens. Non-foodborne routes of transmission, such as from one person to another,
are also major contributors in the spread of these pathogens.
Some pathogens usually cause disease when food is intrinsically contaminated or
cross-contaminated during production, processing or transportation, but may also be
contaminated when prepared by infected persons. Bacterial pathogens in this category
often cause disease after bacteria have multiplied in food after it has been kept at
improper temperatures permitting their multiplication to an infectious dose. Preventing
food contact by persons who have an acute diarrheal illness will decrease the risk of
transmitting these pathogens.
The following represent both types of pathogens that may be transmitted by an infected
food handler:
Astroviruses
Bacillus cereus
Campylobacter jejuni
Clostridium perfringens
Cryptosporidium species
Entamoeba histolytica
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli
Enterotoxigenic E. coli

The 6 Listed Pathogens:
The CDC has designated the 6 organisms listed in the Food Code as having high
infectivity via contamination of food by infected food employees. This designation is
based on the number of confirmed cases reported that involved food employees
infected with one of these organisms and/ or the severity of the medical consequences
to those who become ill.
The following is taken from information provided in the 19th Edition of Control of
Communicable Diseases Manual, the CDC website, and the FDA Bad Bug Book, 2nd
Edition, and is provided as background information on pathogen virulence, infectivity,
and common symptoms exhibited with infection of each of the 6 listed pathogens.
NOROVIRUS
Noroviruses (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae) are small (27-40 nm), round
structured, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses. They are a genetically diverse
group classified into at least five genogroups, designated GI-GV, which are further subdivided into at least 35 genotypes. Noroviruses are recognized as the most common
cause of epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis across all age groups worldwide.
Transmission of norovirus occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, including direct
person-to-person contact and indirect transmission through contaminated food, water,
or environmental surfaces. Vomitus-oral transmission can also occur through
aerosolization followed by direct ingestion or environmental contamination.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
356
 







Noroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Food
handler contact with raw or other ready-to-eat foods is the most common scenario
resulting in foodborne norovirus outbreaks. Norovirus contamination of produce and
shellfish can also occur during production. Secondary household transmission is
common.
Noroviruses are environmentally stable, able to survive both freezing and heating
(although not thorough cooking), are resistant to many common chemical disinfectants,
and can persist on surfaces for up to 2 weeks. Proper hand hygiene and exclusion of
food employees exhibiting symptoms of norovirus disease (i.e., diarrhea or vomiting)
are critical for norovirus control.
Incubation Period: In volunteer studies, the range is 10-50 hours. In foodborne
norovirus outbreaks, the median incubation period is 33 hours.
Symptoms and Complications: Acute-onset of vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea,
abdominal cramps, and nausea, or a combination of these symptoms. Low grade fever
and body aches may also be associated. Symptoms typically last 24 to 72 hours.
Norovirus disease is usually self-limited without any serious long-term sequelae.
Among the young and the elderly, dehydration is a common complication. Volunteer
studies have found that as many as 30% of individuals infected with norovirus are
asymptomatic. There is no specific treatment for norovirus disease. Supportive
therapy consists of oral or intravenous rehydration solutions to replace fluid loss and
electrolytes. Previous exposure does not provide long-term immunity; thus, individuals
may be repeatedly infected throughout their lifetimes.
Infectivity: Noroviruses are highly contagious, and it is thought that an inoculum of as
few as 18 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an individual. Although presymptomatic shedding may occur, shedding usually begins with onset of symptoms,
peaks 4 days after exposure, and may persist for 3 weeks after recovery. However the
degree of infectivity of prolonged shedding has not been determined and peak
contagiousness is during the acute stage of disease. Peak viral loads in both
symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (may be as high as 100 billion viral
particles/g feces).
NONTYPHOIDAL SALMONELLA
Caused by serotypes other than S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.
Unlike previous editions of the FDA Food Code, the 2013 edition requires food
employees to report a diagnosis of nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), prompts the person
in charge to exclude food employees with diagnosis of NTS, and provides conditions for
reinstatement of a food employee who provides to the person in charge written medical
documentation from a health practitioner that states the food employee is free from
NTS, and where appropriate, approval from the regulatory authority
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
357
 
Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica serotypes are among the most common
bacterial cause of foodborne illness. NTS are estimated to cause more than one million
domestically acquired foodborne illnesses in the United States each year (Scallan et. al.
2011), and are the leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths due to foodborne
illness in the United States (Barton-Behravesh et al. 2011, CDC 2011). Whereas
reductions in incidence have been achieved for many other foodborne pathogens in
recent years, no significant change in incidence of NTS infections has occurred since
the start of FoodNet surveillance during 1996–1998 (CDC 2011). Therefore, further
interventions are needed to reduce the incidence of NTS infections.
Commercial food establishments are an important setting for the transmission of NTS,
both in the form of recognized foodborne disease outbreaks as well as sporadic
infections. During 1998 to 2002, the 585 Salmonella enterica outbreaks reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accounted for 49% of all bacterial
outbreaks (Lynch et al. 2006). Forty-six percent of Salmonella outbreaks occurred in
restaurant/deli establishments, the most common setting for Salmonella outbreaks
(Lynch et al. 2006). For the period of 2009-2010, the 243 Salmonella outbreaks
reported to the CDC accounted for 51% of bacterial foodborne disease outbreaks.
Outbreaks of salmonellosis at commercial food establishments frequently involve direct
transmission to patrons from fresh produce or undercooked foods of animal origin, or
cross contamination from these foods. However, numerous NTS outbreak
investigations have implicated food workers as the source of the outbreak or strongly
suggested transmission from food workers (Ethelberg et al. 2004; Greig et al. 2007;
Hedberg et. al. 1991; Hedican et al. 2009; Hundy and Cameron 2002; Khuri-Bulos et al.
1994; Maguire et al. 2000; Medus et al. 2006; Todd et al 2007a, 2007b).
In a study of restaurant-associated salmonellosis outbreaks in Minnesota published by
Medus et al. (2006), the importance of infected food workers as a source of
contamination in the outbreaks was supported by several observations. First, a specific
food vehicle was statistically implicated or suspected in a low proportion of the
restaurant outbreaks (39%), which suggests that the specific food items or food
handling errors were not the primary causes for these outbreaks. Second, food workers
infected with NTS were identified in the majority (83%) of the outbreak investigations.
Infected food workers who reported a history of illness shed NTS in the stool for a
median of 1 month. The authors concluded that regardless of the original source of a
Salmonella outbreak in a restaurant (e.g., raw meat or eggs), the initial source of a
salmonellosis outbreak, food workers frequently serve as reservoirs for NTS and
contribute to transmission to patrons. Thus, assessment of food worker history, i.e.,
symptoms and exposures, testing of stool samples and exclusion or restriction of
infected food workers from the food establishment are essential for controlling
restaurant-associated outbreaks of salmonellosis.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
358
 



In a study of food workers with salmonellosis who were detected through routine
surveillance (Medus et al. 2010), 2.2% of identified culture-confirmed Salmonella cases
were food workers, and identification of these cases were critical to the identification of
numerous outbreaks. The authors concluded that the rapid identification and follow-up
of food workers among reported cases of salmonellosis is important to the early
detection and control of outbreaks in restaurant settings. Importantly, even hostesses,
servers, bartenders, and others who theoretically have limited food preparation duties
can serve as sentinels of transmission within the restaurant. The authors also stated
that food workers should be considered an important source of Salmonella
transmission, and those identified through surveillance should raise a high index of
suspicion of a possible outbreak at their place of work. Food service managers need to
be alert to Salmonella-like illnesses among food workers to facilitate prevention and
control efforts, including exclusion of infected food workers or restriction of their duties.
The biology of NTS and the epidemiology of salmonellosis are complex; food workers
may be an underappreciated part of that complexity. In order to decrease the incidence
of NTS infections in the United States, commercial food establishments should also be
targets for more focused prevention measures, and prevention and control efforts
should consider food workers as an important source of NTS transmission.
General Description:
Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica are bacteria that cause a diarrheal illness
called salmonellosis. NTS are among the most common and important causes of
enteric disease. An estimated 1.2 million cases occur annually in the United States; of
these, approximately 42,000 are culture-confirmed cases reported to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Salmonella lives in the intestines of animals or humans. It can be found in water, food,
soil, or surfaces that have been contaminated with the feces of infected animals or
humans. People can become infected with Salmonella by:
•	 Eating foods contaminated with the bacteria. Contaminated foods are often of
animal origin, such as beef, poultry, unpasteurized milk, or eggs. Fruits and
vegetables may also be contaminated. Any food can be contaminated by an
infected food handler.
•	 Contacting farm animals or pets (including reptiles, amphibians, chicks, and
ducklings), animal feces, or animal environments.
•	 Touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching ones mouth or
putting a contaminated object into ones mouth.
•	 Drinking contaminated water.
Most infections are thought to be acquired through consumption of contaminated food.
Incubation Period:
Symptoms often begin 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria, although it
can take up to a week or more for symptoms to develop in some people.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
359
 





Symptoms and Complications:
Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The illness
usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Persons with NTS infections usually recover without
treatment. However, in approximately 20% of persons, the illness is so severe that
hospitalization is required. In these patients the NTS infection may spread from the
intestine to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless
the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. An estimated 400 fatal cases of
salmonellosis occur each year. A small number of persons experience long-term
consequences from NTS infections, such as arthritis that can last for months or years.
Antibiotic treatment for salmonellosis is generally not indicated for typical intestinal
illness. Antibiotics typically do not shorten the duration of illness or eliminate the carrier
state. However, antibiotic treatment is recommended for persons who develop invasive
(extraintestinal) infections, infants under 2 months of age, the elderly, or those who
have certain underlying medical conditions that predispose them to invasive infection.
Infectivity:
The minimum infectious dose of NTS for humans is generally described as 100 to
1,000 organisms. However, doses of fewer than 10 organisms have caused illness in
multiple outbreaks. Persistence of NTS in the stool after the acute phase of illness is a
well described consequence of NTS infections. This persistence is often referred to as
a temporary carrier state, and the term “shedding” is used to describe the excretion of
Salmonella in the stool.
Studies have consistently shown that the median duration of shedding in the stool to be
4 to 5 weeks after onset of acute gastroenteritis. Persons who have been exposed to
NTS but who never develop symptoms can also be temporary carriers of NTS; these
persons shed NTS for a shorter period of time than persons who experienced illness.
Carriers of NTS are known to shed the bacteria in the stool intermittently. Treatment
with antimicrobials does not eradicate NTS from stool and may actually prolong the
duration of shedding.
SALMONELLA TYPHI
Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (commonly S. Typhi) causes a
systemic bacterial disease, with humans as the only host. This disease is relatively rare
in the United States, with fewer than 500 sporadic cases occurring annually in the U.S.
Worldwide, the annual estimated incidence of typhoid fever is about 17 million cases
with approximately 600,000 deaths. Currently, most cases of S. Typhi in industrialized
nations are imported into the country from developing countries. Antibiotic-resistant
strains have become prevalent in several areas of the world.
Incubation period: Generally 1 to 3 weeks, but may be as long as 2 months after
exposure.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
360
 











Symptoms and Complications: High fever, from 103° to 104°F; lethargy;
gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pains and diarrhea or constipation;
headache; achiness; loss of appetite. A rash of flat, rose-colored spots sometimes
occurs. Septicemia, with colonization of other tissues and organs; e.g., may lead to
endocarditis. Septic arthritis may occur, in which the infection directly affects the joints
and may be difficult to treat. Chronic infection of the gallbladder may occur, which may
cause the infected person to become a carrier.
Infectivity: The minimal infectious dose is estimated to be less than 1000 bacterial
cells. An individual infected with S. Typhi is infectious as long as the bacilli appear in
the excreta, usually from the first week throughout the convalescence; variable
thereafter. About 10% of untreated typhoid fever patients will discharge bacilli for
3 months after onset of symptoms, and 2%-5% become permanent carriers.
SHIGA TOXIN-PRODUCING ESCHERICHIA COLI
E. coli O157:H7 is the most commonly identified serotype of Shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli (STEC) as a cause of foodborne illness in the United States. E. coli
O157:H7 is a zoonotic disease derived from cattle and other ruminants. However, E.
coli O157:H7 also readily transmits from person-to-person, so contaminated raw
ingredients and ill food employees both can be sources of foodborne disease. Other
STEC serotypes have been identified as a source of foodborne illness in the United
States, however not as frequently as E. coli O157:H7. The other serogroups most
commonly implicated as a cause of foodborne illness in the United States are O26,
O111, O103, O45, and O121.
The Food Code definition of STEC covers all E. coli identified in clinical laboratories
that produce Shiga toxins. Nearly 200 O:H combinations of E. coli have been shown to
produce Shiga toxins. The Food Code definition includes all STEC, including those that
have not been specifically implicated in human disease such as hemorrhagic colitis
(i.e., bloody diarrhea) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Infections with STEC may
be asymptomatic but are classically associated with bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic
colitis) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP). [Note: “enterohemorrhagic” (EHEC) is a subset of STEC that has the capacity
to both produce Shiga toxin and cause “attaching and effacing” lesions in the intestine.]
Incubation period: Symptoms usually begin 3 to 4 days after exposure, but the time
may range from 1 to 9 days.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
361
 













Symptoms and Complications: Hemorrhagic colitis is characterized by severe
cramping (abdominal pain), nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea that initially is watery, but
becomes grossly bloody. In some cases, the diarrhea may be extreme, appearing to
consist entirely of blood and occurring every 15 to 30 minutes. Fever typically is lowgrade or absent. Infections from EHEC may range from asymptomatic to mild diarrhea
to severe, life threatening complications (e.g., hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic
syndrome)). About 3% to 7% STEC infections progress to HUS .
Infectivity: The infective dose of E. coli O157:H7 is estimated to be very low, in the
range of 10 to 100 cells. Children under 5 years old are most frequently diagnosed with
infection and are at greatest risk of developing HUS. The elderly also experience a
greater risk of complications. The duration of excretion of STEC in the stool is typically
1 week or less in adults, but can be up to 3 weeks or longer in one-third of infected
children.
SHIGELLA SPP.
Causes an acute bacterial disease, known as shigellosis, and primarily occurs in
humans, but also occurs in other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. An
estimated 300,000 cases of shigellosis occur annually in the U.S. Shigella spp. consist
of 4 species or serogroups, including S. flexneri, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and
S. dysenteriae; which all differ in geographical distribution and pathogenicity. Shigella
spp. are highly infectious and highly virulent. Outbreaks occur in overcrowding
conditions, where personal hygiene is poor, including in institutions, such as prisons,
mental hospitals, day care centers, and refugee camps, and also among men who have
sex with men. Water and RTE foods contaminated by feces, frequently from food
employees’ hands, are common causes of disease transmission. Multidrug-resistant
Shigella (including S. dysenteriae type 1) have appeared worldwide. Concern over
increasing antimicrobial resistance has led to reduced use of antimicrobial therapy in
treating shigellosis.
Incubation period: Eight to 50 hours.
Symptoms and Complications: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and
sometimes vomiting, tenesmus, toxaemia, and cramps. The stools typically contain
blood, pus, or mucus resulting from mucosal ulcerations. The illness is usually selflimited, with an average duration of 5-7 days. Infections are also associated with rectal
bleeding, drastic dehydration, and convulsions in young children. The fatality rate for
Shigella dysenteriae 1 may be as high as 20% among hospitalized cases. Other
complications can also occur, such as reactive arthritis, intestinal perforation, and
hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
362
 










Infectivity: The infectious dose for humans is low, with as few as 10 bacterial cells
depending on age and condition of the host. Infectivity occurs during acute infection
and until the infectious agent is no longer present in feces, usually within 4 weeks after
illness. Asymptomatic carriers may transmit infection; rarely, the carrier state may
persist for months or longer.
HEPATITIS A VIRUS
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a 27-nanometer picornavirus (positive strand RNA, nonenveloped virus). The hepatitis A virus has been classified as a member of the family
Picornaviridae. The exact pathogenesis of HAV infection is not understood, but the
virus appears to invade from the intestinal tract and is subsequently transported to the
liver. The hepatocytes are the site of viral replication and the virus is thought to be
shed via the bile.
HAV is most commonly spread by the fecal-oral route through person-to-person
contact. Risk factors for reported cases of hepatitis A include personal or sexual
contact with another case, illegal drug use, homosexual male sex contact, and travel to
an endemic country. Common source outbreaks also can occur through ingestion of
water or food that has fecal contamination. However, the source of infection is not
identified for approximately 50% of reported cases.
HAV infection is endemic in developing countries, and less common in industrialized
countries with good environmental sanitation and hygienic practices. In the developing
world, nearly all HAV infections occur in childhood and are asymptomatic or cause a
mild illness. As a result, hepatitis A (symptomatic infection with jaundice) is rarely seen
in the developing world. More than 90% of adults born in many developing countries
are seropositive.
Children play an important role in the transmission of HAV and serve as a source of
infection for others, because most children have asymptomatic infections or mild,
unrecognized HAV infections. In the United States, the disease is most common
among school-aged children and young adults. After correction for under-reporting and
undiagnosed infections, an estimated 61,000 HAV infections (includes cases of
hepatitis A as well as asymptomatic infections) occurred in 2003.
HAV Immunization: Immune globulin (IG) can be used to provide passive preexposure immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis A. Protection is immediately conferred
to an exposed individual following administration of IG, and immunity is provided for 3-5
months following inoculation. IG is effective in preventing HAV infection when given as
post-exposure immunoprophylaxis, if given within 14 days of exposure. When a food
employee with hepatitis A is identified, IG is often given to co-workers. Active
immunoprophylaxis using hepatitis A vaccine (a formalin-inactivated, attenuated strain
of HAV) has been shown to provide immunity in > 95% of those immunized, with
minimal adverse reactions.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
363
 














Hepatitis A vaccination of food employee has been advocated, but has not been shown
to be cost-effective and generally is not recommended in the United States, although it
may be appropriate in some communities.
Incubation period: Average 28-30 days (range 15-50 days).
Symptoms and Complications: Illness usually begins with symptoms such as nausea/
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and/or fatigue. Jaundice, dark
urine or light colored stools might be present at onset, or follow illness symptoms within
a few days. HAV infection of older children and adults is more likely to cause clinical
illness with jaundice (i.e., hepatitis A); onset of illness is usually abrupt. In young
adults, 76-97% have symptoms and 40-70% are jaundiced. Jaundice generally occurs
5-7 days after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. For asymptomatic infections,
evidence of hepatitis may be detectable only through laboratory tests of liver infections
such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tests. The disease varies in severity from a
mild illness to a fulminant hepatitis, ranging from 1-2 weeks to several months in
duration. In up to 10-15% of the reported cases, prolonged, relapsing hepatitis for up to
6 months occurs. The degree of severity often increases with age; however, most
cases result in complete recovery, without sequelae or recurrence. The reported case
fatality rate is 0.1% - 0.3% and can reach 1.8% for adults over 50 years old.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis of HAV infection requires specific serological testing for IgM antiHAV. IgM anti-HAV becomes undetectable within 6 months of illness onset for most
persons; however, some persons can remain IgM anti-HAV positive for years after acute
infection. Total anti-HAV (the only other licensed serologic test) can be detected during
acute infection but remains positive after recovery and for the remainder of the person’s
life.
Infectivity: The infective dose of HAV is presumed to be low (10 to 100 viral particles),
although the exact dose is unknown. The viral particles are excreted in the feces of ill
people (symptomatic and asymptomatic) at high densities (106 to 108
/gm) and have
been demonstrated to be excreted at these levels for up to 36 days post-infection.
Evidence indicates maximum infectivity during the latter half of the incubation period,
continuing for a few days after onset of jaundice. Most cases are probably
noninfectious after the first week of jaundice. Chronic shedding of HAV in feces has not
been reported. HAV is shed at peak levels in the feces, one to two weeks before onset
of symptoms, and shedding diminishes rapidly after liver dysfunction or symptoms
appear. Liver dysfunction or symptoms occur at the same time circulating antibodies to
HAV first appear. Immunity after infection probably lasts for life; immunity after
vaccination is estimated to last for at least 20 years.

Reporting History of Exposure:
The reporting requirements for history of exposure are designed to identify employees
who may be incubating an infection due to norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or
other STEC, typhoid fever, HAV.
Which employees who report exposure are restricted?
•	 Employees who work in a food establishment serving a highly susceptible
population (HSP) facility, except those employees who are exposed to
nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS).

Why don’t employees who are exposed to nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) need to be
restricted?
•	 For those employees who are exposed to nontyphoidal Salmonella, exposure
alone does not necessitate restriction of the employee based on epidemiologic
evidence of no increased risk of employees with only a history of exposure
versus employees who were infected and diagnosed.
What constitutes exposure?
•	 Consuming a food that caused illness in another consumer due to infection with
Norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC, typhoid fever, or
HAV.
•	 Attending an event or working in a setting where there is a known disease
outbreak.

•	 Close contact with a household member who is ill and is diagnosed with a listed
pathogen.
Why are other guidelines provided, in addition to restriction for employees serving an
HSP who report exposure to hepatitis A virus?
•	 Employees who have had a hepatitis A illness in the past are most likely

protected from infection by life-time immunity to hepatitis A infection.

•	 Immunity developed through immunization or IgG inoculation prevents hepatitis
A infection in exposed employees.
•	 Our standard definition of HSP doesn’t apply very well to HAV. Children under
6 years old who become infected with HAV are generally asymptomatic, and
while a higher proportion of susceptible elderly who become infected have
serious illness, most institutionalized elderly are protected from HAV by prior
infection.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
365
 








What is the period of restriction?
•	 The period of restriction begins with the most recent time of foodborne or
household member exposure and lasts for the usual incubation period of the
pathogen as defined in the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual. This is
the time that the employee is most likely to begin shedding the pathogen.
o	 For norovirus, 48 hours after the most recent exposure
o	 For Shigella spp., 3 days after the most recent exposure
o	 For E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC, 3 days after the most recent
exposure
o	 For typhoid fever (S. Typhi), 14 days after the most recent exposure
o	 For HAV, 30 days after the most recent exposure
What is the period of restriction when exposed to a diagnosed, ill household member?
•	 While the household member is symptomatic with an infection due to Norovirus,
Shigella spp., E coli O157:H7 or other STEC, typhoid fever (S. Typhi) or HAV;
•	 Plus during the usual incubation period of the pathogen of concern:
o	 For norovirus, symptomatic period plus 48 hours
o	 For Shigella spp., symptomatic period plus 3 days
o	 For E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC, symptomatic period plus 3 days
o	 For typhoid fever (S. Typhi), symptomatic period plus 14 days
o	 For HAV, onset of jaundice plus 30 days
What is the appropriate response to a report of exposure to other food employees?
•	 Employees who report a history of exposure but who do not work in a HSP
facility should be reminded of the requirements for reporting illness, avoidance of
bare hand contact with RTE foods, and proper hand washing and personal
hygiene.

2-201.12 Exclusions and Restrictions.2
Refer to public health reasons for § 2-201.11 for actions to take with conditional
employees.
It is necessary to exclude food employees symptomatic with diarrhea, vomiting, or
jaundice, or suffering from a disease likely to be transmitted through contamination of
food, because of the increased risk that the food being prepared will be contaminated
such as with a pathogenic microorganism. However, if the food employee is suffering
from vomiting or diarrhea symptoms, and the condition is from a non-infectious
condition, Crohn’s disease or an illness during early stages of a pregnancy, the risk of
transmitting a pathogenic microorganism is minimal. In this case, the food employee
may remain working in a full capacity if they can substantiate that the symptom is from
a noninfectious condition. The food employee can substantiate this through providing
to the person in charge medical documentation or other documentation proving that the
symptom is from a noninfectious condition.
Because of the high infectivity (ability to invade and multiply) and/ or virulence (ability to
produce severe disease), of typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi) and hepatitis A virus, a
food employee diagnosed with an active case of illness caused by either of these two
pathogens, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, must be excluded from food
establishments. The exclusion is based on the high infectivity, and/or the severe
medical consequences to individuals infected with these organisms. A food employee
diagnosed with an active case of illness caused by norovirus, Shigella spp., STEC, or
nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), is excluded if exhibiting symptoms of vomiting and
diarrhea, and then allowed to work as the level of risk of pathogen transmission
decreases (See section 2-201.12, Tables #1b, #2 and #3).
The degree of risk for a food employee or conditional employee who is diagnosed with
an infection but asymptomatic with regard to symptoms, to transmit a foodborne
pathogen decreases with the resolution of symptoms. This risk decreases even further
for those employees that are diagnosed with a listed pathogen, but never developed
symptoms. The decrease in risk is taken under consideration when excluding and
restricting diagnosed food employees and results in a slight difference in the way food
employees diagnosed with Norovirus, but asymptomatic with respect to gastrointestinal
symptoms are handled (See section 2-201.12, Table #2).
2
In order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the
employee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.
Reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work
around food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation
are briefly described in Annex 3, § 2-201.11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA
within this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between ADA and the Food Code’s exclusion and restriction
requirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
367
 
Restriction of food employees infected with NTS after resolution of symptoms has not
been a national standard. However, because of the prolonged duration of shedding of
NTS, evidence that food workers have been the source of foodborne outbreaks,
evidence that food workers work while ill (Green et al. 2005), and evidence of
inadequate hand hygiene practices (Green et al. 2006; US FDA 2004), exclusion or
restriction of infected food worker duties is a reasonable public health measure. At a
minimum, potential for transmission and how to prevent it should be discussed with the
food employee and their manager.
There is no epidemiological evidence of an increased risk of NTS transmission from
food employees in highly susceptible populations over the general population. Current
evidence suggests that restriction is sufficient in food establishments that serve either
highly susceptible populations or the non-highly susceptible populations to control
transmission on NTS. Further, events where an infected food handler is involved in
nontyphoidal salmonellosis outbreaks in establishments serving highly susceptible
populations are much less frequent than those in establishments not serving highly
susceptible populations. For example, from 1998-2011, only 41 nontyphoidal
salmonellosis outbreaks were reported to CDC that occurred in nursing home facilities
and 16 outbreaks in hospitals, compared with 731 outbreaks in restaurants or delis.
There are many highly susceptible persons in the general population who eat in regular,
non-institutionalized settings. A more restrictive exclusion criteria for establishments
serving highly susceptible populations is not warranted at this time.

2-201.12 Exclusion and Restrictions (continued)3
Restrictions and exclusions vary according to the population served because highly
susceptible populations have increased vulnerability to foodborne illness. For example,
foodborne illness in a healthy individual may be manifested by mild flu-like symptoms.
The same foodborne illness may have serious medical consequences in
immunocompromised individuals. This point is reinforced by statistics pertaining to
deaths associated with foodborne illness caused by Salmonella Enteritidis. Over 70%
of the deaths in outbreaks attributed to this organism occurred among individuals who
for one reason or another were immunocompromised. This is why the restrictions and
exclusions listed in the Code are especially stringent for food employees serving highly
susceptible populations.
Periodic testing of food employees for the presence of diseases transmissible through
food is not cost effective or reliable. Therefore, restriction and exclusion provisions are
triggered by the active gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by diagnosis and history of
exposure.
The history of exposure that must be reported applies to Norovirus, Hepatitis A, Shigella
spp., STEC and Salmonella Typhi. It does not include nontyphoidal Salmonella.
Upon being notified of the history of exposure, the person in charge should
immediately:
1.	 Discuss the traditional modes of transmission of fecal-oral route pathogens.
2.	 Advise the food employee to observe good hygienic practices both at home and at
work. This includes a discussion of proper handwashing, as described in the Code,
after going to the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling stool-soiled material.
3.	 Review the symptoms listed in the Code that require immediate exclusion from the
food establishment.
4.	 Remind food employees of their responsibility as specified in the Code to inform the
person in charge immediately upon the onset of any of the symptoms listed in the
Code.
5.	 Ensure that the food employee stops work immediately if any of the symptoms
described in the Code develop and reports to the person in charge.
3
In order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the
employee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.
Reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work
around food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation
are briefly described in Annex 3, § 2-201.11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA
within this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between the ADA and the Food Code’s exclusion and
restriction requirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
384
 













A restricted food employee may work in an area of the food establishment that houses
packaged food, wrapped single-service or single-use articles, or soiled food equipment
or utensils. Examples of activities that a restricted person might do include working at
the cash register, seating patrons, bussing tables, stocking canned or other packaged
foods, or working in a non-food cleaning or maintenance capacity consistent with the
criteria in the definition of the term “restricted.” A food employee who is restricted from
working in one food establishment may not work in an unrestricted capacity in another
food establishment, but could work unrestricted in another retail store that is not a food
establishment. A restricted food employee may enter a food establishment as a
consumer.
An excluded individual may not work as a food employee on the premises of any food
establishment.
2-201.13 Removal of Exclusions and Restrictions.4
Food employees diagnosed with Norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Shigella spp., E. coli
O157:H7 or other STEC, nontyphoidal Salmonella and symptomatic with diarrhea,
vomiting, or jaundice, are excluded under subparagraph 2-201.12 (A)(2) or 2­
201.12(B)(2). However these symptomatic, diagnosed food employees differ from
symptomatic, undiagnosed food employees in the requirements that must be met
before returning to work in a full capacity after symptoms resolve.
The person in charge may allow undiagnosed food employees who are initially
symptomatic and whose symptoms have resolved to return to work in a full capacity
24 hours after symptoms resolve.
However, diagnosis with a listed pathogen invokes additional requirements before the
person in charge may allow diagnosed food employees to return to work in full capacity.
Asymptomatic food employees diagnosed with Norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli
O157:H7 or other STEC may not return to work in a full capacity for at least 24 hours
after symptoms resolve. The person in charge shall only allow these food employees to
work on a restricted basis 24 hours after symptoms resolve and they shall only allow
this if not in a food establishment that serves a highly susceptible population. These
restricted food employees remain restricted until they are medically cleared or
otherwise meet the criteria for removal from restriction as specified under

In order to comply with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an exclusion must also be removed if the
employee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk of transmitting the disease.
Reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to another position in which the individual would not work
around food. The steps an employer must take when an excluded employee requests reasonable accommodation
are briefly described in Annex 3, § 2-201.11. However, it is not possible to explain all relevant aspects of the ADA
within this Annex. When faced with an apparent conflict between the ADA and the Food Code’s exclusion and
restriction requirements, employers should contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
385
 



In a food establishment that serves a highly susceptible population, food employees
who are diagnosed with Norovirus, Shigella spp., E. coli O157:H7 or other STEC and
initially symptomatic with vomiting or diarrhea, shall not work on a restricted basis after
being asymptomatic for at least 24 hours. These food employees must remain
excluded until they are medically cleared or otherwise meet the criteria for removal from
exclusion from a highly susceptible population under subparagraph 2-201.13(D)(1)-(2),
2-201.13(E)(1)-(2), or 2-201.13 (F)(1)-(2).
Food employees diagnosed with hepatitis A virus are always excluded if diagnosed
within 14 days of exhibiting any illness symptom, until at least 7 days after the onset of
jaundice, or until medically cleared as specified under subparagraphs
2-201.13(B)(1)-(4).
Food employees diagnosed with hepatitis A virus are always excluded if diagnosed
within 14 days of exhibiting any illness symptom, until at least 7 days after the onset of
jaundice, or until medically cleared as specified under subparagraphs
2-201.13(B)(1)-(3). A food employee with an anicteric infection with the hepatitis A virus
has a mild form of hepatitis A without jaundice. Food employees diagnosed with an
anicteric infection with the hepatitis A virus are excluded if they are within 14 days of
any symptoms. Anicteric, diagnosed food employees shall be removed from exclusion
if more than 14 days have passed since they became symptomatic, or if medically
cleared. Asymptomatic food employees diagnosed with an active infection with the
hepatitis A virus are also excluded until medically cleared.
Food employees diagnosed with typhoid fever (caused by a Salmonella Typhi
infection) are always excluded, even without expressing gastrointestinal symptoms,
since these symptoms are not typically exhibited with typhoid fever. Outbreaks of
foodborne illness involving typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi) have been traced to
asymptomatic food employees who have transmitted the pathogen to food, causing
illness. The high virulence combined with the extremely high infectivity of S. Typhi
warrant exclusion from the food establishment until the food employee has been
cleared by a physician or has completed antibiotic therapy.
Asymptomatic shedders are food employees who do not exhibit the symptoms of
foodborne illness but who are identified through diagnosis, or laboratory confirmation of
their stools to have Norovirus, or any one of the four bacterial pathogens identified in
Chapter 2 in their gastrointestinal system.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
386
 










The risk that food employees who are asymptomatic shedders will transmit a
communicable disease varies depending upon the hygienic habits of the worker, the
food itself and how it is prepared, the susceptibility of the population served, and the
infectivity of the organism. Exclusion in a food establishment that serves a highly
susceptible population affords protection to people who are immune-suppressed.
Restriction in a food establishment that does not serve a highly susceptible population
affords protection for the general population and the immune-suppressed subset of the
general population provided there is adequate attention to personal hygiene and
avoidance of bare-hand contact with RTE foods.
To minimize the risk in all food establishments of the transmission of foodborne disease
by an asymptomatic shedder and based on the factors listed above, all known
asymptomatic shedders of the four bacterial pathogens are either restricted or
excluded, depending on the population served. Requiring restriction for asymptomatic
shedders of all three of the bacterial pathogens results in a uniform criterion and is
consistent with APHA-published recommendations in the "Control of Communicable
Diseases Manual."
Hands and Arms 2-301.11 Clean Condition.
The hands are particularly important in transmitting foodborne pathogens. Food
employees with dirty hands and/or fingernails may contaminate the food being
prepared. Therefore, any activity which may contaminate the hands must be followed
by thorough handwashing in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Code.
Even seemingly healthy employees may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic
microorganisms that are transmissible through food. Staphylococci, for example, can
be found on the skin and in the mouth, throat, and nose of many employees. The
hands of employees can be contaminated by touching their nose or other body parts.
2-301.12 Cleaning Procedure.
Handwashing is a critical factor in reducing fecal-oral pathogens that can be transmitted
from hands to RTE food as well as other pathogens that can be transmitted from
environmental sources. Many employees fail to wash their hands as often as
necessary and even those who do may use flawed techniques.
In the case of a food worker with one hand or a hand-like prosthesis, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission has agreed that this requirement for thorough
handwashing can be met through reasonable accommodation in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Devices are available which can be attached to a
lavatory to enable the food worker with one hand to adequately generate the necessary
friction to achieve the intent of this requirement.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
387
 









The greatest concentration of microbes exists around and under the fingernails of the
hands. The area under the fingernails, known as the “subungal space”, has by far the
largest concentration of microbes on the hand and this is also the most difficult area of
the hand to decontaminate. Fingernail brushes, if used properly, have been found to be
effective tools in decontaminating this area of the hand. Proper use of single-use
fingernail brushes, or designated individual fingernail brushes for each employee,
during the handwashing procedure can achieve up to a 5-log reduction in
microorganisms on the hands.
There are two different types of microbes on the hands, transient and resident
microbes. Transient microbes consist of contaminating pathogens which are loosely
attached to the skin surface and do not survive or multiply. A moderate number of
these organisms can be removed with adequate handwashing. Resident microbes
consist of a relatively stable population that survive and multiply on the skin and they
are not easily washed off the hands. Resident microbes on the hands are usually not a
concern for potential contamination in food service.
All aspects of proper handwashing are important in reducing microbial transients on the
hands. However, friction and water have been found to play the most important role.
This is why the amount of time spent scrubbing the hands is critical in proper
handwashing. It takes more than just the use of soap and running water to remove the
transient pathogens that may be present. It is the abrasive action obtained by
vigorously rubbing the surfaces being cleaned that loosens the transient
microorganisms on the hands.
Research has shown a minimum 10-15 second scrub is necessary to remove transient
pathogens from the hands and when an antimicrobial soap is used, a minimum of 15
seconds is required. Soap is important for the surfactant effect in removing soil from
the hands and a warm water temperature is important in achieving the maximum
surfactant effect of the soap.
Every stage in handwashing is equally important and has an additive effect in transient
microbial reduction. Therefore, effective handwashing must include scrubbing, rinsing,
and drying the hands. When done properly, each stage of handwashing further
decreases the transient microbial load on the hands. It is equally important to avoid
recontaminating hands by avoiding direct hand contact with heavily contaminated
environmental sources, such as manually operated handwashing sink faucets, paper
towel dispensers, and rest room door handles after the handwashing procedure. This
can be accomplished by obtaining a paper towel from its dispenser before the
handwashing procedure, then, after handwashing, using the paper towel to operate the
hand sink faucet handles and restroom door handles.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
388
 










Handwashing done properly can result in a 2-3 log reduction in transient bacteria and a
2-log reduction in transient viruses and protozoa. With heavy contamination of
transient microbial pathogens, (i.e., > 104 microbes, as found on hands contaminated
with bodily wastes and infected bodily fluids) handwashing may be ineffective in
completely decontaminating the hands. Therefore, a further intervention such as a
barrier between hands and ready-to-eat food is necessary.
2-301.13 Special Handwash Procedures.
This section is reserved.
In earlier editions of the Code, FDA's model contained a provision for a Special
Procedure in certain situations. Pursuant to a 1996 Conference for Food Protection
(CFP) Recommendation, the text of this Code provision is removed and the section is
reserved. It is FDA's intent to further research the matter and to submit the findings to
the CFP for reconsideration of the matter.
2-301.14 When to Wash.
The hands may become contaminated when the food employee engages in specific
activities. The increased risk of contamination requires handwashing immediately
before, during, or after the activities listed. The specific examples listed in this Code
section are not intended to be all inclusive. Employees must wash their hands after any
activity which may result in contamination of the hands.
2-301.15 Where to Wash.
Effective handwashing is essential for minimizing the likelihood of the hands becoming
a vehicle of cross contamination. It is important that handwashing be done only at a
properly equipped handwashing facility in order to help ensure that food employees
effectively clean their hands. Handwashing sinks are to be conveniently located,
always accessible for handwashing, maintained so they provide proper water
temperatures and pressure, and equipped with suitable hand cleansers, nail brushes,
and disposable towels and waste containers, or hand dryers. It is inappropriate to wash
hands in a food preparation sink since this may result in avoidable contamination of the
sink and the food prepared therein. Service sinks may not be used for food employee
handwashing since this practice may introduce additional hand contaminants because
these sinks may be used for the disposal of mop water, toxic chemicals, and a variety of
other liquid wastes. Such wastes may contain pathogens from cleaning the floors of
food preparation areas and toilet rooms and discharges from ill persons.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
389
 














2-301.16 Hand Antiseptics.
In the 2005 Food Code, the use of the term “hand sanitizer” was replaced by the term
“hand antiseptic” to eliminate confusion with the term “sanitizer,” a defined term in the
Food Code, and to more closely reflect the terminology used in the FDA Tentative Final
Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products for OTC Human Use, Federal
Register: June 17, 1994.
The term “sanitizer” is typically used to describe control of bacterial contamination of
inert objects or articles, or equipment and utensils, and other cleaned food-contact
surfaces. The Food Code definition of “sanitizer” requires a minimum microbial
reduction of 5 logs, which is equal to a 99.999% reduction. The FDA bases the 5-log
reduction on the AOAC International’s “Official Methods of Analysis 2003,” which
requires a minimum 5-log reduction in microorganisms to achieve “sanitization.”
Sanitizers used to disinfect food-contact equipment and utensils can easily achieve the
5-log reduction of microorganisms and often far exceed this minimum requirement.
However, removing microorganisms from human skin is a totally different process and
sterilization of human skin is nearly impossible to achieve without damaging the skin.
Many antimicrobial hand agents typically achieve a much smaller reduction in
microorganisms than the 5-log reduction required for “sanitization.” Therefore, the
effect achieved from using antimicrobial hand agents is not consistent with the definition
of “sanitization” in the Food Code.
The word “antiseptic” is a Greek term, meaning “against putrefaction”, and eventually
evolved into a second definition, meaning, “a substance used to destroy pathogenic
microorganisms.” The term “antiseptic” is often used to describe agents used on skin to
prevent infection of the skin.
“Antiseptic” is defined under section 201 (o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (o)), as: “The representation of a drug, in its labeling, as an
antiseptic shall be considered to be a representation of a germicide, except in the case
of a drug purporting to be, or represented as, an antiseptic for inhibitory use as a wet
dressing, ointment, dusting powder, or such other use as involves prolonged contact
with the body.”
Section 333.403 of the FDA Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug
Products for OTC Human Use, Federal Register: June 17, 1994, defines a “health-care
antiseptic” as an antiseptic-containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help
prevent infection or to help prevent cross contamination. An “antiseptic handwash” or
“health-care personnel handwash drug product” is defined in Section 333.403 of the
Monograph as an antiseptic containing preparation designed for frequent use; it
reduces the number of transient microorganisms on intact skin to an initial baseline
level after adequate washing, rinsing, and drying; it is a broad spectrum, and persistent
antiseptic containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of
microorganisms on intact skin.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
390
 









Replacing the term “hand sanitizer” with the term “hand antiseptic” allows the use of a
more scientifically appropriate term that is used to describe reduction of
microorganisms on the skin and will improve clarification and regulation of these
products.
The provisions of § 2-301.16 are intended to ensure that an antimicrobial product
applied to the hands is 1) safe and effective when applied to human skin, and 2) a safe
food additive when applied to bare hands that will come into direct contact with food.
Because of the need to protect workers and to ensure safe food, hand antiseptics must
comply with both the human drug and the food safety provisions of the law. The
prohibition against bare hand contact contained in ¶ 3-301.11(B) applies only to an
exposed ready-to-eat food.
As a Drug Product
There are two means by which a hand antiseptic is considered to be safe and effective
when applied to human skin:
1. A hand antiseptic may be approved by FDA under a new drug application
based on data showing safety and effectiveness and may be listed in the
publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm. This document is
maintained by the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Office of Generic Drugs. Also
known as the “Orange Book,” this document provides “product-specific” listings
rather than listings by compound and it is published annually with monthly
supplements. However, as of the end of 1998, no hand antiseptics are listed in
this publication since no new drug applications have been submitted and
approved for these products.
2. A hand antiseptic active ingredient may be identified by FDA in the monograph
for OTC (over-the-counter) Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products under the
antiseptic handwash category. Since hand antiseptic products are intended and
labeled for topical antimicrobial use by food employees in the prevention of
disease in humans, these products are "drugs" under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act § 201(g). As drugs, hand antiseptics and dips must be
manufactured by an establishment that is duly registered with the FDA as a drug
manufacturer; their manufacturing, processing, packaging, and labeling must be
performed in conformance with drug Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's);
and the product must be listed with FDA as a drug product.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
391
 












Products having the same formulation, labeling, and dosage form as those that existed
in the marketplace on or before December 4, 1975, for hand antiseptic use by food
handlers, are being evaluated under the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review by
FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. However, as of May 2005, a final
OTC drug monograph for these products has not been finalized. Therefore, FDA has
not made a final determination that any of these products are generally recognized as
safe and effective (GRAS/E).
GRAS/E antimicrobial ingredients for hand sanitizer use by food handlers will be
identified in a future final monograph issued under the OTC Drug Review. Information
about whether a specific product is covered by the proposed monograph may be
obtained from the tentative final monograph (TFM) for “Health Care Antiseptic Drug
Products for OTC Human Use; Proposed Rule.” This TFM, which was published in the
Federal Register of June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31402), describes the inclusion of hand
sanitizers in this Review on page 31440 under Comment 28 of Part II. Information
about whether a specific product is included in this proposed monograph may also be
available from the manufacturer.
Questions regarding acceptability of a hand antiseptic with respect to OTC compliance
may be directed to the Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance, Center
for Drug Evaluation & Research Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire
Ave., Building 51, 5th Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20993. Specific product
label/promotional information and the formulation are required for determining a
product’s regulatory status.
As a Food Additive
To be subject to regulation under the food additive provisions of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the substances in a hand antiseptic must reasonably be
expected to become a component of food based upon the product’s intended use.
Where the substances in a hand antiseptic are reasonably expected to become a
component of food based upon the product’s intended use, circumstances under which
those substances may be legally used include the following:
1. The intended use of a substance may be exempted from regulation as a food
additive under 21 CFR 170.39 Threshold of regulation for substances used in
food-contact articles. A review by FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition is required in order to determine whether such an exemption can be
granted.
2. The intended use of a substance, including substances that contact food such as
those in hand antiseptics, may be “generally recognized as safe (GRAS)” within
the meaning of the FFDCA. A partial listing of substances with food uses that
are generally recognized as safe may be found in CFR Parts 182, 184, and 186.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
392
 







These lists are not exhaustive because the FFDCA allows for independent
GRAS determinations.
For the use of a substance to be GRAS within the meaning of the FFDCA, there
must be publicly available data that demonstrate that the substance is safe for its
intended use. There also must be a basis to conclude that there is a consensus
among qualified experts that these publicly available data establish safety. If the
use of a substance in food is GRAS, it is not subject to premarket review by
FDA. While there is no legal requirement to notify FDA of an independent GRAS
determination, a number of firms have chosen to do so with the expectation of
receiving a response letter from FDA (see FDA’s Inventory of GRAS Notices at
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSaf
eGRAS/GRASListings/default.htm). Although such a letter does not affirm the
independent GRAS determination, it is an opportunity for the firm to receive
comment from FDA regarding the materials supporting its determination.
3. The intended use of a substance may be the subject of a prior sanction, which is
an explicit approval by the FDA or the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) prior to September 6, 1958. All known prior sanctions are published
under 21 CFR Part 181.
4. A substance may be the subject of a Food Contact Substance Notification that
became effective in accordance with the FFDCA Section 409 (h). Substances
that are the subject of an effective food-contact substance notification are listed,
along with conditions of safe use, in the FDA Inventory of Effective Food Contact
Substance (FCS) Notifications. This list is available on-line at: Inventory of
Effective Food Contact Substance (FCS) Notifications
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFC
S/ucm116567.htm). A food-contact substance that is the subject of an effective
notification submitted under FFDCA 409(h) does not include similar or identical
substances manufactured or prepared by any person other than the
manufacturer identified in that notification.
The Division of Food Contact Substance Notifications does not certify or provide
approvals for specific products. However, if the intended use of a substance in contact
with food meets the requirements of 21 CFR 170.39 Threshold of regulation for
substances used in food-contact articles, FDA may provide a letter to a firm stating that
the intended use of this product is exempt from regulation as a food additive. However,
the product must be the subject of a new drug application or under FDA’s OTC Drug
Review to be legally marketed.
Questions regarding the regulatory status of substances in hand antiseptics as food
additives may be directed to the Division of Food Contact Substance Notifications,
HFS-275, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740. It may be helpful or
necessary to provide label/promotional information when inquiring about a specific
substance.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
393
 












Fingernails 2-302.11 Maintenance.
The requirement for fingernails to be trimmed, filed, and maintained is designed to
address both the cleanability of areas beneath the fingernails and the possibility that
fingernails or pieces of the fingernails may end up in the food due to breakage. Failure
to remove fecal material from beneath the fingernails after defecation can be a major
source of pathogenic organisms. Ragged fingernails present cleanability concerns and
may harbor pathogenic organisms.
Jewelry 2-303.11 Prohibition.
Items of jewelry such as rings, bracelets, and watches may collect soil and the
construction of the jewelry may hinder routine cleaning. As a result, the jewelry may
act as a reservoir of pathogenic organisms transmissible through food.
The term “jewelry” generally refers to the ornaments worn for personal adornment and
medical alert bracelets do not fit this definition. However, the wearing of such bracelets
carries the same potential for transmitting disease-causing organisms to food. If a food
worker wears a medical alert or medical information bracelet, the conflict between this
need and the Food Code’s requirements can be resolved through reasonable
accommodation in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The person in
charge should discuss the Food Code requirement with the employee and together they
can work out an acceptable alternative to a bracelet. For example, the medical alert
information could be worn in the form of a necklace or anklet to provide the necessary
medical information without posing a risk to food. Alternatives to medical alert bracelets
are available through a number of different companies (e.g., an internet search using
the term “medical alert jewelry” leads to numerous suppliers).
An additional hazard associated with jewelry is the possibility that pieces of the item or
the whole item itself may fall into the food being prepared. Hard foreign objects in food
may cause medical problems for consumers, such as chipped and/or broken teeth and
internal cuts and lesions.
Outer Clothing 2-304.11 Clean Condition.
Dirty clothing may harbor diseases that are transmissible through food. Food
employees who inadvertently touch their dirty clothing may contaminate their hands.
This could result in contamination of the food being prepared. Food may also be
contaminated through direct contact with dirty clothing. In addition, employees wearing
dirty clothes send a negative message to consumers about the level of sanitation in the
establishment.

Prevention
2-401.11 Eating, Drinking, or Using Tobacco.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
394
 






Proper hygienic practices must be followed by food employees in performing assigned
duties to ensure the safety of the food, prevent the introduction of foreign objects into
the food, and minimize the possibility of transmitting disease through food. Smoking or
eating by employees in food preparation areas is prohibited because of the potential
that the hands, food, and food-contact surfaces may become contaminated. Insanitary
personal practices such as scratching the head, placing the fingers in or about the
mouth or nose, and indiscriminate and uncovered sneezing or coughing may result in
food contamination. Poor hygienic practices by employees may also adversely affect
consumer confidence in the establishment.
Food preparation areas such as hot grills may have elevated temperatures and the
excessive heat in these areas may present a medical risk to the workers as a result of
dehydration. Consequently, in these areas food employees are allowed to drink from
closed containers that are carefully handled.
2-401.12 Discharges from the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth.
Discharges from the eyes, nose, or mouth through persistent sneezing or coughing by
food employees can directly contaminate exposed food, equipment, utensils, linens,
and single-service and single-use articles. When these poor hygienic practices cannot
be controlled, the employee must be assigned to duties that minimize the potential for
contaminating food and surrounding surfaces and objects.
Hair Restraints 2-402.11 Effectiveness.
Consumers are particularly sensitive to food contaminated by hair. Hair can be both a
direct and indirect vehicle of contamination. Food employees may contaminate their
hands when they touch their hair. A hair restraint keeps dislodged hair from ending up
in the food and may deter employees from touching their hair.
Animals 2-403.11 Handling Prohibition.
Dogs and other animals, like humans, may harbor pathogens that are transmissible
through food. Handling or caring for animals that may be legally present is prohibited
because of the risk of contamination of food employee hands and clothing.
2-501.11 Clean-up of Vomiting and Diarrheal Events.
When an employee, customer, or other individual vomits or has a diarrheal event in a
food establishment, there is a real potential for the spread of harmful pathogens in the
establishment. Putting the proper response into action in a timely manner can help
reduce the likelihood that food may become contaminated and that others may become
ill as a result of the accident.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
395
 







According to the CDC, Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks
in the United States. More specifically, Noroviruses are the most common cause of
sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus is the most common
cause of gastroenteritis in people of all ages and it is responsible for greater than 50%
of all foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks. CDC estimates that 21 million cases of
acute gastroenteritis are due to Norovirus infection.
Noroviruses can be highly contagious, and it is thought that an inoculum of as few as
10-18 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an individual. Transmission occurs via
foodborne and person-to-person routes, airborne inhalation of vomitus droplets, and
also through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Good evidence exists
for transmission due to aerosolization of vomitus that presumably results in droplets
contaminating surfaces or entering the oral mucosa and being swallowed.
In addition, the potential transmission level of Norovirus shed in the feces at levels up to
1 trillion viral particles per gram of feces and one projectile vomiting incident can
contaminate the environment with 300,000 viral particles. One study found that
employees who reported having cleaned up vomitus were more likely to contract illness
that those who did not.
Norovirus causes acute onset of vomiting (often explosive) and diarrhea (also often
explosive) which can contaminate surfaces and become airborne increasing the
chances of additional infections. A recent study has also shown that the bathroom
environment was identified as a major reservoir of human Norovirus, even in the
absence of an ill individual on site. Studies have shown that Norovirus can survive on
fomite surfaces for up to at least 5 days at room temperature and that routine cleaning,
without a disinfectant specifically to address Norovirus, may be ineffective in eliminating
its presence on fomite surfaces and can even serve as a means of spreading the virus
to other fomites.
Effective clean up of vomitus and fecal matter in a food establishment should be
handled differently from routine cleaning procedures. It should involve a more stringent
cleaning and disinfecting process. Some compounds that are routinely used for
sanitizing food-contact surfaces and disinfecting countertops and floors, such as certain
quaternary ammonium compounds, may not be effective against Norovirus. It is
therefore important that food establishments have procedures for the cleaning and
disinfection of vomitus and/or diarrheal contamination events that address, among other
items, the use of proper disinfectants at the proper concentration.
Consumers are at risk of contracting Norovirus illness from direct exposure to vomitus
or from exposure to airborne Norovirus from vomitus. Additionally, exposed food
employees are also at risk of contracting Norovirus illness and can subsequently
transfer the virus to ready-to-eat food items served to consumers.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
396
 



The Food Code specifies that the Person in Charge is to exclude or restrict a food
employee who exhibits, or reports a symptom, or who reports a diagnosed illness or a
history of exposure to Norovirus. A clean-up and response plan is intended to address
situations where a food employee or other individual becomes physically ill in areas
where food may be prepared, stored or served. Once such an episode has occurred,
timely effective clean-up is imperative.
When developing a plan that addresses the need for the cleaning and disinfection of a
vomitus and/or diarrheal contamination event, a food establishment should consider:
•	 the procedures for containment and removal of any discharges, including
airborne particulates;
•	 the procedure for cleaning, sanitizing, and, as necessary, the disinfection of
any surfaces that may have become contaminated;
•	 the procedures for the evaluation and disposal of any food that may have
been exposed to discharges;
•	 the availability of effective disinfectants, personal protective equipment, and
other cleaning and disinfecting equipment and appurtenances intended for
response and their proper use;
•	 procedures for the disposal and/or cleaning and disinfection of tools and
equipment used to clean up vomitus or fecal matter;
•	 the circumstances under which a food employee is to wear personal
protective equipment for cleaning and disinfecting of a contaminated area;
•	 notification to food employees on the proper use of personal protective
equipment and procedures to follow in containing, cleaning, and disinfecting a
contaminated area;
•	 the segregation of areas that may have been contaminated so as to minimize
the unnecessary exposure of employees, customers and others in the facility
to the discharges or to surfaces or food that may have become
contaminated;
•	 minimizing risk of disease transmission through the exclusion and restriction
of ill employees as specified in §2-201.12 of the Food Code;
•	 minimizing risk of disease transmission through the prompt removal of ill
customers and others from areas of food preparation, service and storage;
and
•	 the conditions under which the plan will be implemented.
When a food employee has been diagnosed, has recent history or exposure to, or is
the suspect source of a confirmed disease outbreak of Norovirus, it must be reported to
the person in charge per the FDA Food Code in subparagraphs 2-201.11 (A)(2)(a),
2-201.11(A)(4)(a), 2-201.11(A)(5)(a), and ¶2-201.11(B). If a food employee has been
diagnosed with Norovirus it must also be reported to the regulatory authority. Refer to
public health reasons for §2-201.11 Responsibility of the Person in Charge, Food
Employees, and Conditional Employees for more information about appropriate
employee health policies.

Chapter 3 Food
Condition 3-101.11 Safe, Unadulterated, and Honestly Presented.
Sources 3-201.11 Compliance with Food Law.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-401.11.
Source
A primary line of defense in ensuring that food meets the requirements of § 3-101.11 is
to obtain food from approved sources, the implications of which are discussed below.
However, it is also critical to monitor food products to ensure that, after harvesting and
processing, they do not fall victim to conditions that endanger their safety, make them
adulterated, or compromise their honest presentation. The regulatory community,
industry, and consumers should exercise vigilance in controlling the conditions to which
foods are subjected and be alert to signs of abuse. FDA considers food in hermetically
sealed containers that are swelled or leaking to be adulterated and actionable under the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Depending on the circumstances, rusted and
pitted or dented cans may also present a serious potential hazard.
Food, at all stages of production, is susceptible to contamination. The source of food is
important because pathogenic microorganisms may be present in the breeding stock of
farm animals, in feeds, in the farm environment, in waters used for raising and freezing
aquatic foods, and in soils and fertilizers in which plant crops are grown. Chemical
contaminants that may be present in field soils, fertilizers, irrigation water, and fishing
waters can be incorporated into food plants and animals.
Sources of molluscan shellfish are a particular concern because shellfish are frequently
consumed raw or in an undercooked state and thus receive neither heat treatment nor
any other process that would destroy or inactivate microbial pathogens. For safety,
these foods must be accompanied by certification that documents that they have been
harvested from waters that meet the water quality standards contained in the National
Shellfish Sanitation Program Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish. Certification
also provides confidence that processing, packaging, and shipping have been
conducted under sanitary conditions.
Food should be purchased from commercial supplies under regulatory control. Home
kitchens, with their varieties of food and open entry to humans and pet animals, are
frequently implicated in the microbial contamination of food. Because commercial items
seldom are eaten right away, the home kitchen's limited capacity for maintaining food at
proper temperatures may result in considerable microbial growth and toxin production
by microorganisms introduced through the diverse sources of contamination.
Controlled processing is required for the safe preparation of food entering commerce.

Labeling - General
Sources of packaged food must be labeled in accordance with law. Proper labeling of
foods allows consumers to make informed decisions about what they eat. Many
consumers, as a result of an existing medical condition, may be sensitive to specific
foods or food ingredients. This sensitivity may result in dangerous medical
consequences should certain foods or ingredients be unknowingly consumed. In
addition, consumers have a basic right to be protected from misbranding and fraud.
Except for certain species of large tuna and raw molluscan shellfish, if fish are intended
for raw consumption, they must be properly frozen before they are served. If this
process is done off-premises, purchase specifications ensuring that proper freezing
techniques are used to destroy parasites must be provided. Labeling should
accompany the product to advise as to whether the product was frozen properly. This is
necessary because fish from natural bodies of water may carry parasitic worms that can
infect and injure consumers who eat such raw fish dishes as sushi, ceviche, green
(lightly marinated) herring, and cold-smoked salmon. The worms are often deeply
imbedded inside fish muscle. Thorough freezing kills these worms if the fish are
subjected to a low enough temperature for a long enough time.
Labeling for Fish
Except for raw molluscan shellfish, certain species of large tuna, certain aquacultured
fish, and fish eggs that have been removed from the skein and rinsed, if fish are
intended for raw or undercooked consumption, they must be properly frozen before
they are served. If this process is done off-premises, purchase specifications ensuring
that proper freezing techniques are used to destroy parasites must be provided.
Labeling or other information should accompany the product to advise as to whether
the product was frozen properly. This is necessary because fish from natural bodies of
water may carry parasitic worms that can infect and injure consumers who eat such raw
fish dishes as sushi, ceviche, green (lightly marinated) herring, and cold-smoked
salmon. The worms are often deeply imbedded inside fish muscle. Thorough freezing
kills these worms if the fish are subjected to a low enough temperature for a long
enough time.
Labeling for Juice
On July 8, 1998, FDA announced in the Federal Register a final rule that revised its
food labeling regulations to require a warning statement on fruit and vegetable juice
products that have not been processed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic
microorganisms that may be present. FDA took this action to inform consumers,
particularly those at greatest risk, of the hazard posed by such juice products. FDA
expects that providing this information to consumers will allow them to make informed
decisions on whether to purchase and consume such juice products, thereby reducing
the incidence of foodborne illnesses and deaths caused by the consumption of these
juices.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
399
 







On July 18, 2001 FDA announced a final rule designed to improve the safety of fruit and
vegetable juice and juice products. Under the rule, juice processors must use Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles for juice processing. Processors
making shelf-stable juices or concentrates that use a single thermal processing step are
exempt from the microbial hazard requirements of the HACCP regulation. Retail
establishments where packaged juice is made and only sold directly to consumers
(such as juice bars) are not required to comply with this regulation.
Rather, the Food Code requires fresh fruit or vegetable juices that are packaged at
retail (untreated juices or beverages containing untreated juices that are offered to
consumers as prepackaged foods) to be processed under HACCP with a 5 log
reduction in pathogens of concern OR bear the warning statement as specified in
21 CFR Section 101.17(g). That statement is: “WARNING: This product has not been
pasteurized and, therefore, may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness
in children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.” Refer to
Chapter 1 for the definition of juice. It is important to note that the definition of "juice"
includes puréed fruits and vegetables, which are commonly prepared for service to
highly susceptible populations.
Food establishments that serve a highly susceptible population (HSP) cannot serve
prepackaged juice that bears the warning label and they must serve only pasteurized
juice. For juice only, this population includes children who are age 9 or less and receive
food in a school, day care setting, or similar facility that provides custodial care.
Unpackaged juice (glasses of juice prepared at a juice bar, for example) does not
require the 5 log reduction nor a warning statement or other consumer advisory (juice is
not an animal food and therefore not covered by section 3-603.11) when prepared and
served at retail. Usually the juice is served by the glass or in small batches compared
to a commercial juice processor. The risk of using “drops” and damaged fruits or
vegetables is much less at retail because of buyer specs that provide higher quality
produce, meaning that fruits for juicing are less likely to be of a lower quality or
damaged.
Additional information is available in the document, “Guidance for Industry: Exemptions
from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice - Recommendations for Effectively
Achieving a 5-Log Pathogen Reduction; Final Guidance”, October 7, 2002 which can

Products Labeling and Dietary Supplements.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
400
 






Labeling for Meat and Poultry
Retail food establishments that process and package meat or poultry in a form that is
not ready-to-eat, are obligated by Federal regulation to label the product with safe food
handling instructions. USDA issued final rules on August 8, 1994 requiring all raw meat
or poultry products have a safe-handling label or sticker or be accompanied by a leaflet
that contains information on proper handling and cooking procedures. The intent of this
requirement is to ensure that all consumers are alerted to the fact that such products
may contain bacteria and that food safety hinges upon their thoroughly cooking the
product, regardless of where they obtain the products. That is, the labeling would exist
if they obtain their meat and poultry at an establishment that handles only prepackaged
and prelabeled products or if they obtain their meat or poultry at an operation such as a
supermarket with a meat processing operation or from a small neighborhood butcher.
Labeling Guidance for Irradiated Raw Meat and Meat Products
In December 1999, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection
Service (USDA/FSIS) issued a final regulation to permit the use of ionizing radiation to
reduce foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, and extend the shelf
life of raw refrigerated and frozen meat and meat products (Irradiation of Meat Food
Products 64 Federal Register 72150, December 23, 1999).
The final regulations are published in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR
424.21 Use of food ingredients and sources of radiation and provide that raw
refrigerated products may receive a maximum absorbed dose of no more than 4.5 kGy,
and that frozen product receive no more than 7.0 kGy, in accordance with the FDA
restrictions provided for in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR
179.26(a) Ionizing radiation for the treatment of food, (a) Energy sources). The
regulations further require that all irradiated meat and meat products bear labeling that
reflects that the product was irradiated, or that the product contains an irradiated meat
or poultry product. This labeling requirement is applicable even at retail facilities where
irradiated coarse ground beef might be finely ground for retail sale, or in cases where
irradiated product is combined with other non-irradiated meat or poultry product for
retail sale.
In cases where the entire package of product is irradiated, the labeling must include
both a statement and the international symbol, called the radura. Additionally, the
product name must include the word “irradiated,” or the labeling must bear a disclosure
statement such as, “treated with radiation” or “treated by irradiation.” If either statement
is used, the logo must be placed in conjunction with the statement. If an irradiated
meat or meat product is used to formulate a multi-ingredient product with other nonirradiated components, the irradiated meat ingredient must be identified as such in the
ingredients statement, but the logo is not required. For example, the ingredients
statement for a Chicken and Beef Sausage product that contains irradiated beef would
be, Ingredients: chicken, irradiated beef, seasonings (salt, pepper, spice), and the logo
would not be required to be present.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
401
 






All labels for products produced at federally inspected establishments bearing
statements about irradiation must be submitted to USDA/FSIS for evaluation and
approval prior to use.
Optional labeling statements about the purpose of the irradiation process may be
included on the labeling of irradiated products provided they are not false or misleading
and have been evaluated first by USDA/FSIS. If such statements indicate a specific
benefit from irradiation, such as a reduction of microbial pathogens, such statements
must be substantiated by processing documentation and validated through the
processing and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. Such
validation and documentation of the HACCP system would only be applicable in
federally inspected establishments.
Because irradiation can substantially reduce and, in some situations, eliminate any
detectable level of pathogenic bacteria, it is important that the meat products be held at
the proper refrigerated temperatures to prevent growth of any pathogens present, and
that the packaging is not compromised. Although co-mingling irradiated beef with nonirradiated meat or poultry is not prohibited under the current regulations, USDA/FSIS
believes that such a process would decrease the benefit of irradiation by potentially
exposing the irradiated product to pathogenic bacteria. While FSIS considers such
comingling to be highly unlikely, if it did occur, a statement advising the consumer that
the product contains both irradiated and non-irradiated components would be required.
The Radura, International Symbol:

7700.1, Irradiation of Meat and Poultry Products, on the USDA/FSIS website at

Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
402
 












Labeling for Raw Shell Eggs
The Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 101.17 Food Labeling warning, notice, and
safe handling statements, paragraph (h) Shell eggs state in subparagraph (1), “The
label of all shell eggs, whether in intrastate or interstate commerce, shall bear the
following statement: ‘SAFE HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS: To prevent illness from
bacteria; keep eggs refrigerated, cook eggs until yolks are firm, and cook foods
containing eggs thoroughly.’” Further, in subparagraph (4) it states, “Shell eggs that
have been, before distribution to consumers, specifically processed to destroy all viable
Salmonella shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.”
Labeling for Whole-muscle, Intact Beef Steaks
In order for a food establishment operator to know that a steak is a whole-muscle, intact
cut of beef that can therefore be undercooked and served without a consumer advisory,
the incoming product must be labeled. Processors can accommodate this need at the
retail level by developing proposed labels, obtaining the necessary USDA Food Safety
Inspection Service review and approval, and appropriately affixing the labels to their
products.
Refer also to public health reason for § 3-602.11.
3-201.12 Food in a Hermetically Sealed Container.
Processing food at the proper high temperature for the appropriate time is essential to
kill bacterial spores that, under certain conditions in an airtight container, begin to grow
and produce toxin. Of special concern is the lethal toxin of Clostridium botulinum, an
organism whose spores (i.e., survival stages for non-growth conditions) are found
throughout the environment. Even slight underprocessing of low acid food which is
canned can be dangerous, because spoilage microbes are killed and there are no signs
to warn consumers that botulinum spores have germinated into vegetative cells and
produced their toxin. If these foods are not processed to be commercially sterile, they
must be received frozen or under proper refrigeration.
Refer also to the public health reason for §§ 3-101.11 and 3-201.11.
3-201.13 Fluid Milk and Milk Products.
Milk, which is a staple for infants and very young children with incomplete immunity to
infectious diseases, is susceptible to contamination with a variety of microbial
pathogens such as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and
Listeria monocytogenes, and provides a rich medium for their growth. This is also
true of milk products. Pasteurization is required to eliminate pathogen contamination in
milk and products derived from milk. Dairy products are normally perishable and must
be received under proper refrigeration conditions.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
403
 













3-201.14 Fish.
After December 18, 1997, all processors of fish are required by 21 CFR 123 to have
conducted a hazard analysis of their operation, identify each hazard that is reasonably
likely to occur, and implement a HACCP plan to control each identified hazard.
Retailers should assure that their seafood suppliers have complied with this
requirement. Hazards known to be associated with specific fish species are discussed
in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide, available from the
FDA Office of Seafood. Species-related hazards include pathogens, parasites, natural
toxins, histamine, chemicals, and drugs.
The seafood implicated in histamine poisoning are the scombroid toxin-forming species,
defined in 21 CFR 123.3(m) as meaning bluefish, mahi-mahi, tuna, and other species,
whether or not in the family Scombridae, in which significant levels of histamine may
be produced in the fish flesh by decarboxylation of free histidine as a result of exposure
of the fish after capture to temperatures that allow the growth of mesophilic bacteria.
Ciguatera toxin is carried to humans by contaminated fin fish from the extreme
southeastern U.S., Hawaii, and subtropical and tropical areas worldwide. In the south
Florida, Bahamian, and Caribbean regions, barracuda, amberjack, horse-eye jack,
black jack, other large species of jack, king mackerel, large groupers, and snappers are
particularly likely to contain ciguatoxin. Many other species of large predatory fishes
may be suspect. In Hawaii and throughout the central Pacific, barracuda, amberjack,
and snapper are frequently ciguatoxic, and many other species both large and small are
suspect. Mackerel and barracuda are frequently ciguatoxic from mid to northeastern
Australian waters.
RECREATIONALLY CAUGHT FISH
Recreationally caught fish received for sale or service may be approved by the
regulatory authority. The EPA recognizes that fish are a healthy part of our diet and
recognizes fishing as an all-American recreational pastime, however, they add the
cautionary note that some individuals, such as pregnant women and small children,
may need to limit their intake of certain noncommercial fish. Recreationally caught fish
may contain possible contaminants that may pose health risks. Fish advisories can be
found in EPA Listing of Fish Advisories the EPA website at:
http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/.
States issue fish consumption advisories if elevated concentrations of chemicals such
as mercury or dioxin are found in local fish. For most people, the risk from mercury by
eating fish is not a health concern. Yet, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of
mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system.
Therefore, the FDA and the EPA recently advised women who may become pregnant,
pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and
eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.
(http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fishadvice/advice.html).
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
404
 










State-issued advisories apply primarily to non-commercial fish obtained through sport,
recreation, and subsistence activities. Each advisory is different; it may recommend
unrestricted, limited, or totally restricted consumption; may be targeted to everyone or
limited to women, children, or other people at risk; and may apply to certain species or
sizes of fish or a specific waterbody.
States may issue safe-eating guidelines in addition to issuing fish advisories. A fish
advisory is issued to warn the public of the potential human health risks from chemical
contamination of certain species from particular types of waterbodies such as lakes,
rivers, and/ or coastal waters within the State. In contrast, a safe-eating guideline is
issued to inform the public that fish from specific waterbodies have been tested for
chemical contaminants and the fish from these waters are safe to eat without
consumption restrictions.
Regulatory authorities are encouraged to monitor and review the National Listing of Fish
Advisories (See August 2004 EPA Fact Sheet at
http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/advisories/factsheet.pdf as well as the local
listings, as part of the decision-making process regarding the approval of recreationally
caught fish being used in food establishments.
3-201.15 Molluscan Shellfish.
Pathogens found in waters from which molluscan shellfish are harvested can cause
disease in consumers. Molluscan shellfish include: 1) oysters; 2) clams; 3) mussels;
and, 4) scallops, except where the final product is the shucked adductor muscle only.
The pathogens of concern include both bacteria and viruses.
Pathogens from the harvest area are of particular concern in molluscan shellfish
because: 1) environments in which molluscan shellfish grow are commonly subject to
contamination from sewage, which may contain pathogens, and to naturally occurring
bacteria, which may also be pathogens; 2) molluscan shellfish filter and concentrate
pathogens that may be present in surrounding waters; and, 3) molluscan shellfish are
often consumed whole, either raw or partially cooked.
To minimize the risk of molluscan shellfish containing pathogens of sewage origin, State
and foreign government agencies, called Shellfish Control Authorities, classify waters in
which molluscan shellfish are found, based, in part, on an assessment of water quality.
As a result of these classifications, molluscan shellfish harvesting is allowed from some
waters, not from others, and only at certain times or under certain restrictions from
others. Shellfish Control Authorities then exercise control over the molluscan shellfish
harvesters to ensure that harvesting takes place only when and where it has been
allowed.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
405
 












Significant elements of Shellfish Control Authorities' efforts to control the harvesting of
molluscan shellfish include: 1) a requirement that containers of in-shell molluscan
shellfish (shellstock) bear a tag that identifies the type and quantity of shellfish,
harvester, harvest location, and date of harvest; and, 2) a requirement that molluscan
shellfish harvesters be licensed; 3) a requirement that processors that shuck molluscan
shellfish or ship, reship, or repack the shucked product be certified; and, 4) a
requirement that containers of shucked molluscan shellfish bear a label with the name,
address, and certification number of the shucker-packer or repacker.
Pathogens, such as Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio cholerae,
and Listeria monocytogenes that may be present in low numbers at the time that
molluscan shellfish are harvested, may increase to more hazardous levels if they are
exposed to time/temperature abuse. To minimize the risk of pathogen growth, Shellfish
Control Authorities place limits on the time between harvest and refrigeration. The
length of time is dependant upon either the month of the year or the average monthly
maximum air temperature (AMMAT) at the time of harvest, which is determined by the
Shellfish Control Authority.
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) results from shellfish feeding upon toxic
microorganisms such as dinoflagellates. In the U.S., PSP is generally associated with
the consumption of molluscan shellfish from the northeast and northwest coastal
regions of the U.S. PSP in other parts of the world has been associated with molluscan
shellfish from environments ranging from tropical to temperate waters. In addition, in
the U.S., PSP toxin has recently been reported from the viscera of mackerel, lobster,
dungeness crabs, tanner crabs, and red rock crabs.
Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) in the U.S. is generally associated with the
consumption of molluscan shellfish harvested along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
and, sporadically, along the southern Atlantic coast. There has been a significant
occurrence of toxins similar to NSP in New Zealand, and some suggestions of
occurrence elsewhere.
For diarrhetic shellfish poisoning there has been no documented occurrence to date in
the U.S. However, instances have been documented in Japan, southeast Asia,
Scandinavia, western Europe, Chile, New Zealand, and eastern Canada.
Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is generally associated with the consumption of
molluscan shellfish from the northeast and northwest coasts of North America. It has
not yet been a problem in the Gulf of Mexico, although the algae that produce the toxin
have been found there. ASP toxin has recently been identified as a problem in the
viscera of dungeness crab, tanner crab, red rock crab, and anchovies along the west
coast of the United States.
Marine toxins are not ordinarily a problem in scallops if only the adductor muscle is
consumed. However, products such as roe-on scallops and whole scallops do present
a potential hazard for natural toxins.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
406
 








To reduce the risk of illness associated with raw shellfish consumption, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) administers the National Shellfish Sanitation Program
(NSSP). The NSSP is a tripartite, cooperative action plan involving Federal and State
public health officials and the shellfish industry. Those groups work together to improve
shellfish safety. States regularly monitor waters to ensure that they are safe before
harvesting is permitted. FDA routinely audits the States' classification of shellfish
harvesting areas to verify that none pose a threat to public health. Patrolling of closed
shellfishing waters minimizes the threat of illegal harvesting or "bootlegging" from
closed waters. Bootlegging is a criminal activity and a major factor in shellfish-borne
illnesses. Purchases from certified dealers that adhere to NSSP controls is essential to
keep risks to a minimum.
3-201.16 Wild Mushrooms.
Over 5000 species of fleshy mushrooms grow naturally in North America. The vast
majority have never been tested for toxicity. It is known that about 15 species are
deadly and another 60 are toxic to humans whether they are consumed raw or cooked.
An additional 36 species are suspected of being poisonous, whether raw or cooked. At
least 40 other species are poisonous if eaten raw, but are safe after proper cooking.
Some wild mushrooms that are extremely poisonous may be difficult to distinguish from
edible species. In most parts of the country there is at least one organization that
includes individuals who can provide assistance with both identification and program
design. Governmental agencies, universities, and mycological societies are examples
of such groups.
Regulatory authorities have expressed their difficulty in regulating wild harvested
mushrooms at retail. There are many different approaches in regulating the sale and
service of wild harvested mushrooms. The differences in approach could be due to
geography, the type of wild mushrooms that typically grow in a particular region and/or
local/state laws that are enforced. The Conference for Food Protection (CFP) has
attempted to develop a national model or standards for regulatory programs to address
and recognize wild harvested mushroom identification. The difficulty in trying to get
consensus on national model/standards lies in the question of what is the best national
model/standard available that state/local regulatory authorities can apply in a
meaningful way to ensure wild harvested mushrooms sold at retail are obtained from a
safe source.
With the change in the codified text, the regulatory authority will have the flexibility to
apply their laws and/or policies for wild harvested mushroom identification. At a
minimum, when developing a wild harvest mushroom identification program, the
following elements should be addressed:
•	 Developing resources & criteria to select wild mushroom species for service or
sale,
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
407
 







•	 Establishing record-keeping and traceability to assure safety of wild harvested
mushrooms,
•	 Written buyer specifications that include:
a.	 Identification by the scientific name and the common name of the
mushroom species,
b. A statement that the mushroom was identified while in the fresh states,
c.	 The name and contact information of the person who identified the
mushroom and the mushroom seller, and
d. A statement as to the qualifications and training of the identifier,
specifically related to mushroom identification.
•	 Development of qualifications and training curriculum that could be used for
further training of mushroom identifiers
In addition, the CFP has guidance material titled “Draft Model Guidance for Wild
Harvested Mushrooms” posted on their website at www.foodprotect.org so state and
local regulatory authorities can use the information to develop and implement their own
wild harvested mushroom program. The guidance document is still a work in progress.
Refer also to the public health reason for §§ 3-101.11 and 3-201.11.
3-201.17 Game Animals.
The primary concern regarding game animals relates to animals obtained in the wild.
Wild game animals may be available as a source of food only if a regulatory inspection
program is in place to ensure that wild animal products are safe. This is important
because wild animals may be carriers of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, or parasites that
cause illness (zoonoses) in humans. Some of these diseases can be severe in the
human host. In addition to the risk posed to consumers of game that is not subject to
an inspection program, there is risk to those who harvest and prepare wild game
because they may contract infectious diseases such as rabies or tularemia.
Specifications
for Receiving
3-202.11 Temperature.
Temperature is one of the prime factors that controls the growth of bacteria in food.
Many, though not all, types of pathogens and spoilage bacteria are prevented from
multiplying to microbiologically significant levels in properly refrigerated foods that are
not out of date. USDA published a final rule (63 FR 45663, August 27, 1998 Shell Eggs;
Refrigeration and Labeling Requirements) to require that shell eggs packed for
consumer use be stored and transported at an ambient temperature not to exceed
7.2ºC (45ºF).
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
408
 













High temperatures for a long enough time, such as those associated with thorough
cooking, kill or inactivate many types of microorganisms. However, cooking does not
always destroy the toxins produced in foods by certain bacteria (such as the
enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus). Cooking or hot holding that follows
temperature abuse may not make the food safe. Keeping cooked foods hot as required
in the Code prevents significant regrowth of heat-injured microorganisms and prevents
recontamination with bacteria that are newly introduced.
3-202.12 Additives.
It is imperative for safety that food supplies come from sources that are in compliance
with laws regarding chemical additives and contaminants.
Food additives are substances which, by their intended use, become components of
food, either directly or indirectly. They must be strictly regulated. In excessive amounts
or as a result of unapproved application, additives may be harmful to the consumer.
Unintentional contaminants or residues also find their way into the food supply. The
tolerances or safe limits designated for these chemicals are determined by risk
assessment evaluations based on toxicity studies and consumption estimates.
Food and Color additives must be used in compliance with a federal food, or color
additive regulation, an effective food-contact notification, or a threshold of regulation
exemption. Such regulations, notifications, and exemptions are generally composed of
three parts: the identity of the substance, specifications including purity or physical
properties, and limitations on the conditions of use. In order for a food, or color additive
use to be in compliance, the use must comply with all three criteria.
Federal Food Additive regulations are found in Title 21 CFR, Parts 172-180. Color
additive regulations are found in Title 21 CFR Parts 73-Subpart A, 74-Subpart A, 81
and 82. Effective food-contact notifications are listed at
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnNavigation.cfm?rpt=fcsListing&displayAll=f
alse&page=17, and threshold of regulation exemptions are listed at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/ThresholdRegul
ationExemptions/ucm093685.htm.
Other substances that are added to food include those prior sanctioned for use in food
by either the FDA or USDA, or those generally recognized as safe for their intended use
in food. Some of these are listed in Title 21 CFR Parts 181-186, Title 9 CFR Section
424.21(b) and at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/NoticeInventory/default.h
tm. Tolerances and exemptions from tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in or on
food are found in Title 40 CFR Part 180. Substances that are prohibited form use in
human food are listed in Title 21 CFR Part 189.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
409
 














3-202.13 Eggs.
Damaged shells permit the entry of surface bacteria to the inside of eggs. Eggs are an
especially good growth medium for many types of bacteria. Damaged eggs must not
be used as food.
The Definition of "Restricted Egg" contains several terms that are explained in this
paragraph. An egg may be restricted because it is a/an:
(i)	 "Check" meaning an egg that has a broken shell or crack in the shell but has
its shell membranes intact and contents not leaking.
(ii)	 "Dirty egg or Dirties" meaning an egg that has a shell that is unbroken and has
adhering dirt, foreign material, or prominent stains.
(iii)	 "Incubator reject" meaning an egg that has been subjected to incubation and
has been removed from incubation during the hatching operations as infertile
or otherwise unhatchable.
(iv)	 "Inedible" meaning eggs of the following descriptions: Black rots, yellow rots,
white rots, mixed rots, sour eggs, eggs with green whites, eggs with stuck
yolks, moldy eggs, musty eggs, eggs showing blood rings, and eggs
containing embryo chicks (at or beyond the blood ring stage).
(v)	 "Leaker" meaning an egg that has a crack or break in the shell and shell
membranes to the extent that the egg contents are exposed or are exuding or
free to exude through the shell.
(vi)	 "Loss" meaning an egg that is unfit for human food because it is smashed or
broken so that its contents are leaking; or overheated, frozen, or
contaminated; or an incubator reject; or because it contains a bloody white,
large meat spots, a large quantity of blood, or other foreign material.
On December 5, 2000 Federal regulations were amended to require that shell egg
cartons bear safe handling instructions and be placed under refrigeration at 45°F or
lower upon delivery at retail establishments (65 FR 76091, December 5, 2000, Food
Labeling, Safe Handling Statements, Labeling of Shell Eggs; Refrigeration of Shell
Eggs Held for Retail Distribution). The amended provisions include:
•	 21 CFR Part 16 Regulatory Hearing before the Food and Drug Administration,
§ 16.5 Inappplicability and limited applicability, (4) A hearing on an order for relabeling, diversion or destruction of shell eggs…
•	 21 CFR Part 101 Food Labeling § 101.17 Food labeling warning, notice, and
safe handling statements, (h) Shell eggs.
•	 21 CFR Part 115 Shell Eggs, § 115.50 Refrigeration of shell eggs held for retail
distribution.

The labeling rule became effective September 4, 2001, and the refrigeration rule
became effective June 4, 2001. These rules are one part of a larger farm-to-table
approach for ensuring the safety of our nation’s egg supply. The public health goal is a
50 percent reduction in all salmonellosis and a 50 percent reduction in Salmonellae
Enteritidis illnesses by 2010.
3-202.14 Eggs and Milk Products, Pasteurized.
Liquid egg, fluid milk, and milk products are especially good growth media for many
types of bacteria and must be pasteurized. Pasteurization is a heat process that will kill
or inactivate bacteria and other harmful microorganisms likely to be in these
time/temperature control for safety foods. Freezing and drying of unpasteurized
products will stop microbial growth and may reduce their bacterial populations; however,
some organisms will survive because neither process invariably kills bacteria. Under
certain conditions, freezing and drying may preserve microbes. An alternative to
pasteurization may be applicable to certain cheese varieties cured or aged for a
specified amount of time prior to marketing for consumption.
3-202.15 Package Integrity.
Damaged or incorrectly applied packaging may allow the entry of bacteria or other
contaminants into the contained food. If the integrity of the packaging has been
compromised, contaminants such as Clostridium botulinum may find their way into
the food. In anaerobic conditions (lack of oxygen), botulism toxin may be formed.
Packaging defects may not be readily apparent. This is particularly the case with low
acid canned foods. Close inspection of cans for imperfections or damage may reveal
punctures or seam defects. In many cases, suspect packaging may have to be
inspected by trained persons using magnifying equipment. Irreversible and even
reversible swelling of cans (hard swells and flippers) may indicate can damage or
imperfections (lack of an airtight, i.e., hermetic seal). Swollen cans may also indicate
that not enough heat was applied during processing (underprocessing). Suspect cans
must be returned and not offered for sale.
3-202.16 Ice.
Freezing does not invariably kill microorganisms; on the contrary, it may preserve them.
Therefore, ice that comes into contact with food to cool it or that is used directly for
consumption must be as safe as drinking water that is periodically tested and approved
for consumption.

3-202.17	 Shucked Shellfish, Packaging and
Identification.
Plastic containers commonly used throughout the shellfish industry for shucked product
bear specific information regarding the source of the shellfish as required by the NSSP
Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish. These containers must be nonreturnable
so that there is no potential for their subsequent reuse by shellfish packers which could
result in shucked product that is inaccurately identified by the label. The reuse of these
containers within the food establishment must be assessed on the basis of the Food
Code's criteria for multi-use containers and the likelihood that they will be properly
relabeled to reflect their new contents.
3-202.18 Shellstock Identification.
Accurate source identification of the harvesting area, harvester, and dealers must be
contained on molluscan shellstock identification tags so that if a shellfish-borne disease
outbreak occurs, the information is available to expedite the epidemiological
investigation and regulatory action.
3-202.19 Shellstock, Condition.
Dirty, damaged, or dead shellstock can contaminate and degrade live and healthy
shellstock and lead to foodborne illness. Harvesters have the primary responsibility for
culling shellstock, but this responsibility continues throughout the distribution chain.
3-202.110	 Juice Treated.
Refer to public health reason for § 3-801.11.
Original
Containers and
Records
3-203.11 Molluscan Shellfish, Original Container.
Lot separation is critical to isolating shellfish implicated in illness outbreaks and tracking
them to their source. Proper identification is needed for tracing the origin and
determining conditions of shellfish processing and shipment. If the lots are commingled
at retail, traceability is undermined and the root of the problem may remain undetected.
If no causative factors are identified in the food establishment, tracing the incriminated
lot helps in identifying products that need to be recalled or growing waters that may
need to be closed to harvesting.
When shucked shellfish are prepackaged in consumer self service containers, the
labeling information as specified under section 3-202.17 must be recorded on a log
sheet to correlate with the date of sale of the consumer sized containers.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
412
 






3-203.12 Shellstock, Maintaining Identification.
Accurate records that are maintained in a manner that allows them to be readily
matched to each lot of shellstock provide the principal mechanism for tracing shellstock
to its original source. If an outbreak occurs, regulatory authorities must move quickly to
close affected growing areas or take other appropriate actions to prevent further
illnesses. Records must be kept for 90 days to allow time for hepatitis A virus
infections, which have an incubation period that is significantly longer than other
shellfish-borne diseases, to come to light. The 90 day requirement is based on the
following considerations:
Shelf-life of the product..........................................14 days

Incubation period ...................................................56 days

Medical diagnosis and confirmation....................... 5 days

Reporting ............................................................... 5 days

Epidemiological investigation .................................10 days

Total .......................................................................90 days

In reality and as stated in the provision, the 90-day “clock” starts at the time the
container of shellstock is emptied. Starting from the date of harvest is not correct
because the shellstock may be sold/consumed in less than the 14 days of shelf life
cited in the chart above. Therefore, the 90 days may expire and the tag discarded
before an illness is reported and investigated.
Shellstock could be frozen in the food establishment during the 14-day estimated shelf
life period, which would effectively stop the clock on the shelf life. The shellstock could
be thawed and consumed past the 14-day shelf life. In this case, the 90 days would
expire before consumption if the clock started 90 days from the harvest date.
Freezing shellstock in the food establishment is not usually done because, although
oysters-in-the-shell can be frozen with fair results, they do not have the same texture
and appearance of a fresh oyster when thawed. Commercially frozen oysters are
frozen rapidly to retain product quality.
Preventing
Contamination
by Employees
3-301.11 Preventing Contamination from Hands.
In November 1999, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for
Foods (NACMCF) concluded that bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods can
contribute to the transmission of foodborne illness and agreed that the transmission
could be interrupted. The NACMCF recommended exclusion/restriction of ill food
workers as the first preventative strategy and recognized that this intervention has
limitations, such as trying to identify and manage asymptomatic food workers.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
413
 








The three interdependent critical factors in reducing foodborne illness transmitted
through the fecal-oral route, identified by the NACMCF, include exclusion/restriction of
ill food workers; proper handwashing; and no bare hand contact with ready-to-eat
foods. Each of these factors is inadequate when utilized independently and may not be
effective. However, when all three factors are combined and utilized properly, the
transmission of fecal-oral pathogens can be controlled. Depending on the microbial
contamination level on the hands, handwashing with plain soap and water, as specified
in the Food Code, may not be an adequate intervention to prevent the transmission of
pathogenic microbes to ready-to-eat foods via hand contact with ready-to-eat foods.
Handwashing as specified in the Food Code will reduce microbial contamination of the
hands by 2-3 logs.
Food employees and conditional employees infected with fecal-oral pathogens can
shed viral and protozoan pathogens in the feces at levels up to 108 viral particles or
oocysts per gram of feces. Having a high potential contamination level on the hands
combined with a very low infectious dose necessary to cause infection are the reasons
that FDA believes that handwashing alone is not an effective single barrier in the
transmission of these fecal-oral pathogens. The infective dose for Giardia and
Cryptosporidium is believed to be as low as 1-10 oocysts, and as few as 10 virus
particles can infect an individual with Norovirus or hepatitis A.
The CDC now estimates that Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the
United States. Contaminated hands are a significant factor in the transmission of
enteric viruses, including Norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Further, contamination of
food by an infected food worker is the most common mode of transmission of hepatitis
A in foodborne disease outbreaks. Research has shown the viral transfer rate from
contaminated hands to ready-to-eat food to be about 10% and that proper handwashing
will significantly reduce the chance of transmitting pathogenic viruses. However, with
heavy initial contamination of the hands, especially in the subungal space of the fingers,
a basic 2-3 log reduction handwash procedure may not be adequate to prevent the
transmission of viral foodborne illness.
Even though bare hands should never contact exposed, ready-to-eat food, thorough
handwashing is important in keeping gloves or other utensils from becoming vehicles
for transferring microbes to the food.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
414
 







If a ready-to-eat food is being added as an ingredient to a food item that is
subsequently subjected to a pathogen kill step (such as adding cheese or other readyto-eat toppings to a pizza dough or adding vegetables to a raw meat dish before
cooking) then strict prohibition of bare hand contact is not necessary. Cooking foods to
the temperatures required in the Food Code will reduce the likelihood of survival of
pathogens that might be transferred from an employee’s hands to the surface of the
ready-to-eat foods. The exception specifically targets bare hand contact with ready-toeat food at the time it is added as an ingredient to food that will be cooked in the food
establishment to the minimum temperatures specified in the Food Code. The exception
does not apply when adding ready-to-eat foods as ingredients to foods that will only be
lightly heated, melted, or browned rather than cooked to the minimum temperatures
specified in this section. Nor does this exception apply when adding ready-to-eat foods
as ingredients to foods that are intended for preparation by the consumer offsite. When
proper heat treatment is used in combination with the exclusion/restriction of ill food
workers and proper handwashing, the proper heat treatment provides an additional
means of interrupting disease transmission.
Refer to the public health reasons for §§ 2-301.11, 2-301.12, and 2-301.14.
3-301.11(E) Prior Approval for Food Employees to Touch
Ready-to-Eat Food with Bare Hands
Infected food employees are the source of contamination in approximately one in five
foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the United States with a bacterial or viral
cause.1 Most of these outbreaks involve enteric, i.e., fecal-oral agents. These are
organisms that employees were shedding in their stools at the time the food was
prepared. Because of poor or nonexistent handwashing procedures, workers spread
these organisms to the food. In addition, infected cuts, burns, or boils on hands can
also result in contamination of food. Viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents can be
involved.
Traditionally, food regulations have required two methods of preventing the spread of
foodborne disease by this mode of transfer, i.e., they have prohibited food workers from
preparing food when they are infectious and have required thorough and frequent
handwashing. In order to strengthen fecal-oral transmission interventions, the Food
Code provides focused and specific guidance about ill workers and when handwashing
must occur. As a final barrier, bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat food (i.e., food that is
edible without washing or is not subsequently subjected to a pathogen kill step) is
prohibited and suitable utensils such as spatulas, tongs, single-use gloves, or
dispensing equipment are required to be used.

State Department of Health data 1980-1991 published: Weingold, Guzewich, Fudala, 1994, Use of Foodborne
Disease Data for HACCP Risk Assessment. J. Food Prot. 53: 820-830.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
415
 












Because highly susceptible populations include persons who are
immunocompromised, the very young and the elderly, establishments serving
these populations may not use alternatives to the no bare hand contact with
ready-to-eat food requirement.
Acceptability of an alternative procedure to no bare hand contact requires prior approval
from the regulatory authority based on the food establishment having a written
employee health policy that details how the establishment complies with management
of ill employees as specified under sections 2-201.11 - .13 and management of
handwashing practices as specified under Part 2-3 of the Code. The approval should
also be based on evidence provided through written procedures and documentation
that at least all of the following are addressed:
(A) Personal Cleanliness, i.e., handwashing procedures, including frequency and
methodology of handwashing that ensure food employees keep their hands and
fingertips clean and handwashing occurs at the times specified in section 2-301.14,
including after using the toilet and between tasks that may recontaminate the hands.
(B) Hygienic Practices as specified in Part 2-4.
(C) Employee Health regarding:
(1) Reporting of diseases and medical conditions, and
(2) Exclusions and restrictions, i.e., that food employees and conditional
employees report their health status as specified in section 2-201.11; ill food
employees are restricted or excluded as specified in section 2-201.12; and the
exclusions and restrictions are removed as specified in section 2-201.13;
(D) How the alternative practices and procedures will control the hazard
through an active managerial control program. Such a program includes
monitoring and verifying the institution of the provisions described in paragraphs A-C
above and satisfies the following:
(1) The public health hazard associated with bare hand contact specific to the
food establishment operation is identified and understood. The regulatory
authority needs assurance that the permit holder recognizes that the hazard
being addressed is the possible contamination of ready-to-eat food by viral and
parasitic as well as bacterial pathogens that are transferred from employees’
hands.
(2) The ready-to-eat foods that will be contacted with bare hands are identified
and both procedures and practices are in place so that food employees wash
their hands before returning to their work station and cross-contamination from
touching raw and ready-to-eat food is precluded.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
416
 









For example, identifying the specific type of food to be prepared, such as tacos,
and the specific location, such as a situation where a food employee is assigned
solely to the designated taco work station. The work station is located
immediately adjacent to the taco assembly unit and the employee will be
preparing only the specified ready-to-eat food using bare hands.
Another example could be a food employee who is responsible solely for
assembling a variety of ready-to-eat foods.
(3) Institution of an effective training program for food employees that emphasizes
not working when ill with any of the gastrointestinal symptoms listed in the Code, and
explains good hygienic practices, proper handwashing procedures, and safe food
preparation procedures. This should include a documented training plan that
specifies how management responsibility for training has been designated, training
program content, and the frequency of administration including periodic refresher
sessions.
(E) The alternative procedure should clearly describe monitoring, documentation, and
verification actions to ensure that the practices and procedures are followed.
Corrective actions need to be predetermined for situations where the practices and
procedures are not followed, e.g., an ill employee is found preparing foods.
(F) Documentation of the practices, procedures, and corrective actions related to an
alternative to no bare hand contact with ready-to-eat food must be maintained and
readily available at the food establishment at all times for use by the person in
charge and for review by the regulatory authority.
Preventing
Food and
Ingredient
Contamination
3-302.11 Packaged and Unpackaged Food – Protection
Separation, Packaging, and Segregation.
It is important to separate foods in a ready-to-eat form from raw animal foods during
storage, preparation, holding and display to prevent them from becoming contaminated
by pathogens that may be present in or on the raw animal foods. An exception is
permitting the storage and display of frozen, commercially packaged raw animal food
adjacent to or above frozen, commercially packaged ready-to-eat food. The freezer
equipment should be designed and maintained to keep foods in the frozen state.
Corrective action should be taken if the storage or display unit loses power or otherwise
fails. Raw or ready-to-eat foods or commercially processed bulk-pack food that is
packaged on-site presents a greater risk of cross-contamination. Additional product
handling, drippage during the freezing process, partial thawing or incomplete seals on
the package increase the risk of cross-contamination from these products packaged inhouse.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
417
 







With regard to the storage of different types of raw animal foods as specified under
subparagraph 3-302.11(A)(2), it is the intent of this Code to require separation based
on anticipated microbial load and raw animal food type (species). Separating different
types of raw animal foods from one another during storage, preparation, holding and
display will prevent cross-contamination from one to the other. The required separation
is based on a succession of cooking temperatures as specified under § 3-401.11 which
are based on thermal destruction data and anticipated microbial load. For example, to
prevent cross-contamination, fish and pork, which are required to be cooked to an
internal temperature of 145°F for 15 seconds, shall be stored above or away from raw
poultry, which is required to be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F for 15
seconds due to its considerably higher anticipated microbial load. In addition, raw
animal foods having the same cooking temperature, such as pork and fish, shall be
separated from one another during storage and preparation by maintaining adequate
spacing or by placing the food in separate containers because of the potential for
allergen cross-contamination or economic adulteration via inadvertent species
substitution.
Food that is inadequately packaged or contained in damaged packaging could become
contaminated by microbes, dust, or chemicals introduced by products or equipment
stored in close proximity or by persons delivering, stocking, or opening packages or
overwraps. Packaging must be appropriate for preventing the entry of microbes and
other contaminants such as chemicals. These contaminants may be present on the
outside of containers and may contaminate food if the packaging is inadequate or
damaged, or when the packaging is opened. The removal of food product overwraps
may also damage the package integrity of foods under the overwraps if proper care is
not taken.
3-302.12	 Food Storage Containers, Identified with
Common Name of Food.
Certain foods may be difficult to identify after they are removed from their original
packaging. Consumers may be allergic to certain foods or ingredients. The mistaken
use of an ingredient, when the consumer has specifically requested that it not be used,
may result in severe medical consequences.
The mistaken use of food from unlabeled containers could result in chemical poisoning.
For example, foodborne illness and death have resulted from the use of unlabeled salt,
instead of sugar, in infant formula and special dietary foods. Liquid foods, such as oils,
and granular foods that may resemble cleaning compounds are also of particular
concern.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
418
 




3-302.13	 Pasteurized Eggs, Substitute for Raw Shell
Eggs for Certain Recipes.
Raw or undercooked eggs that are used in certain dressings or sauces are particularly
hazardous because the virulent organism Salmonella Enteritidis may be present in
raw shell eggs. Pasteurized eggs provide an egg product that is free of pathogens and
is a ready-to-eat food. The pasteurized product should be substituted in a recipe that
requires raw or undercooked eggs.
3-302.14	 Protection from Unapproved Additives.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-202.12.
Use of unapproved additives, or the use of approved additives in amounts exceeding
those allowed by food additive regulations could result in foodborne illness, including
allergic reactions. For example, many adverse reactions have occurred because of the
indiscriminate use of sulfites to retard "browning" of fruits and vegetables or to cause
ground meat to look "redder" or fresher.
The concern for misuse of additives also applies to food establishments operating
under a variance and to Annex 6 Food Processing Criteria which addresses the use of
sodium nitrite or other curing agents in smoking and curing operations. However, if this
process is done incorrectly, it could cause illness or death because of excessive nitrite
or because the food is insufficiently preserved.
3-302.15 Washing Fruits and Vegetables.
Pathogenic microorganisms, such as Salmonella spp., and chemicals such as
pesticides, may be present on the exterior surfaces of raw fruits and vegetables. It has
been assumed that washing removes the majority of organisms and/or chemicals
present; however, more recent studies have demonstrated washing to fall short of their
complete removal. Biofilm development by Salmonella allows bacterial cells to survive
under adverse environmental conditions and also reduces the ability to remove
pathogens by washing, even with antimicrobial agents. All fresh produce, except
commercially washed, pre-cut, and bagged produce, must be thoroughly washed under
running, potable water or with chemicals as specified in Section 7-204.12, or both,
before eating, cutting or cooking. Even if you plan to peel or otherwise alter the form of
the produce, it is still important to remove soil and debris first.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
419
 




Infiltration of microorganisms can occur through stem scars, cracks, cuts or bruises in
certain fruits and vegetables during washing. Once internalized, bacterial pathogens
cannot be removed by further washing or the use of sanitizing solutions. To reduce the
likelihood of infiltration, wash water temperature should be maintained at 10°F warmer
than the pulp temperature of any produce being washed. Because certain fruits and
vegetables are susceptible to infiltration of microorganisms during soaking or
submersion, it is recommended that soaking or submerging produce during cleaning be
avoided. It is important to follow practices that minimize pathogens in the water or on
the surface of produce. It is important that proper handwashing procedures are
followed, in accordance with Section 2-301.12 Cleaning Procedure, before and after
handling fresh produce.
Scrubbing with a clean brush is only recommended for produce with a tough rind or
peel, such as carrots, cucumbers or citrus fruits that will not be bruised easily or
penetrated by brush bristles. Scrubbing firm produce with a clean produce brush and
drying with a clean cloth towel or fresh disposable towel can further reduce bacteria that
may be present. Washing fresh fruits and vegetables with soap, detergent or other
surfactants should be avoided as they facilitate infiltration and may not be approved for
use on food. Toxic or undesirable residues could be present in or on the food if
chemicals used for washing purposes are unapproved or applied in excessive
concentrations. Unless otherwise stipulated in 21 CFR 173.315, chemicals used to
wash or peel fruits and vegetables should not exceed the minimum amount required to
accomplish the intended effect, need to be accurately tested for proper concentration,
and must adhere to any indications as dictated on the product label.
Many pre-cut, bagged produce items are pre-washed. If so, these products will be
identified as such on the package label, and can be used as ready-to-eat without further
washing. The label should also state if further washing is recommended or necessary.
Precut or prewashed produce in open bags should not be washed before use. After
being cut, certain produce such as melons, leafy greens and tomatoes are considered
time/temperature control for safety food (TCS) requiring time/temperature control for
safety and should be refrigerated at 41°F or lower to prevent any pathogens that may
be present from multiplying. For more retail food guidance on the storage and handling
of tomatoes, leafy greens, and other produce, you may consult the FDA Program

On October 26, 1998 a voluntary guidance document for the produce industry which
addresses microbial hazards and good agricultural and management practices
commonly used by fresh fruit and vegetable producers was issued jointly by FDA,
USDA, and CDC. This voluntary guidance contains useful information related to
washing fruits and vegetables as well as the application of antimicrobial agents and was
updated on August 19, 2003. This “Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards
for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables”, October 26, 1998, is available from FDA’s Food
Safety Initiative staff and also on the Internet at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati

Additionally, in February 2008, the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
(CFSAN) issued “Guidance for Industry, Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety
Hazards of Fresh-cut Fruits and Vegetables,” which covers fresh-cut fruits and
vegetables that have been minimally processed (e.g. no kill step) and altered in form,
by peeling, slicing, chopping, shredding, coring, or trimming with or without washing or
other treatment, prior to being packaged for use by the consumer or a retail
establishment. This guide is available at:

Preventing
Contamination
from Ice Used
as a Coolant
3-303.11 Ice Used as Exterior Coolant, Prohibited as
Ingredient.
Ice that has been in contact with unsanitized surfaces or raw animal foods may contain
pathogens and other contaminants. For example, ice used to store or display fish or
packaged foods could become contaminated with microbes present on the fish or
packaging. If this ice is then used as a food ingredient, it could contaminate the final
product.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
421
 












3-303.12	 Storage or Display of Food in Contact with
Ice and Water.
Packages that are not watertight may allow entry of water that has been exposed to
unsanitary exterior surfaces of packaging, causing the food to be contaminated. This
may also result in the addition of water to the food that is unclaimed in the food's
formulation and label.
Unpackaged foods such as fresh fish are often stored and/or displayed on ice. A
potential for increasing the microbial load of a food exists because, as the ice melts,
pathogens from one food may be carried by water to other foods. The potential for
contamination is reduced by continuous draining of melting ice.
Preventing
Contamination
From Equipment,
Utensils, and
Linens
3-304.11 Food Contact with Equipment and Utensils.
Pathogens can be transferred to food from utensils that have been stored on surfaces
which have not been cleaned and sanitized. They may also be passed on by
consumers or employees directly, or indirectly from used tableware or food containers.
Some pathogenic microorganisms survive outside the body for considerable periods of
time. Food that comes into contact directly or indirectly with surfaces that are not clean
and sanitized is liable to such contamination. The handles of utensils, even if
manipulated with gloved hands, are particularly susceptible to contamination.
Probe-type price or identification tags are defined as a utensil. This means that if such
tags are for multiuse, they must meet the criteria listed in Parts 4-1 Materials for
Construction and Repair, and 4-2 Design and Construction. Probe-type price or product
identification tags can cause microbial, chemical, or physical contamination if not
properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
The Food Code defines gloves as a "utensil" and therefore gloves must meet the
applicable requirements related to utensil construction, cleaning, and storage.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
422
 









3-304.12 In-Use Utensils, Between-Use Storage.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-304.11.
Once a food employee begins to use a utensil such as a ladle, spatula, or knife, that
has been previously cleaned and sanitized, it is then considered an in-use utensil. Inuse utensils, used on a continuous or intermittent basis during preparation or
dispensing, must be cleaned and sanitized on a schedule that precludes the growth of
pathogens that may have been introduced onto utensil surfaces. In-use utensils may
be safely stored in hot water maintained at 135o
F or above during intermittent use
because microbial growth is controlled at such temperatures.
A food utensil should be designed and used to prevent bare hand contact with ready-toeat food or to minimize contact with food that is not in a ready-to-eat form. On-site
evaluations can be made to determine if a utensil is improperly designed for the task or
whether a food employee is misusing an appropriately designed utensil.
3-304.13 Linens and Napkins, Use Limitation.
Because of their absorbency, linens and napkins used as liners that contact food must
be replaced whenever the container is refilled. Failure to replace such liners could
cause the linens or napkins to become fomites.
3-304.14 Wiping Cloths, Use Limitation.
Soiled wiping cloths, especially when moist, can become breeding grounds for
pathogens that could be transferred to food. Any wiping cloths that are not dry (except
those used once and then laundered) must be stored in a sanitizer solution of adequate
concentration between uses. Wiping cloths soiled with organic material can overcome
the effectiveness of, and neutralize, the sanitizer. The sanitizing solution must be
changed as needed to minimize the accumulation of organic material and sustain
proper concentration. Proper sanitizer concentration should be ensured by checking
the solution periodically with an appropriate chemical test kit.
Wiping down a surface with a reusable wet cloth that has been properly stored in a
sanitizer solution is an acceptable practice for wiping up certain types of food spills and
wiping down equipment surfaces. However, this practice does not constitute cleaning
and sanitizing of food contact surfaces where and when such is required to satisfy the
methods and frequency requirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.
The same is true of the practice of wiping down a surface using dry disposable towels
and a spray bottle containing pre-mixed sanitizing solution. This practice is not
prohibited, however it alone does not constitute proper cleaning and sanitizing of food
contact surfaces where and when such is required to satisfy the methods and frequency
requirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
423
 












Further, for the purpose of wiping up food spills from surfaces in situations where full
cleaning and sanitizing is not required (such as when a soft drink overflows onto the
side of a cup or onto a countertop) the use of dry cloths and disposable towels is also
acceptable as long as the cloth or towel is used for no other purpose. Again, this does
not constitute a proper cleaning and sanitizing procedure for a food contact surface,
when such is called for in 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.
In order to effectively clean and sanitize food contact surfaces, where and when
required to satisfy the requirements in Parts 4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code, the surface
must be first cleaned properly to remove organic material. In most cases this requires
use of detergents or other cleaners such as described in Section 4-603.14 of the Food
Code. After the surface is clean to sight and touch, a sanitizing solution of adequate
temperature with the correct chemical concentration should then be applied to the
surface. The sanitizing solution must stay on the surface for a specific contact time as
specified in this Code and in accordance with the manufacturer’s EPA-registered label,
as applicable.
3-304.15 Gloves, Use Limitation.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-304.11.
Gloves used in touching ready-to-eat food are defined as a "utensil" and must meet the
applicable requirements related to utensil construction, good repair, cleaning, and
storage.
Multiuse gloves, especially when used repeatedly and soiled, can become breeding
grounds for pathogens that could be transferred to food. Soiled gloves can directly
contaminate food if stored with ready-to-eat food or may indirectly contaminate food if
stored with articles that will be used in contact with food. Multiuse gloves must be
washed, rinsed, and sanitized between activities that contaminate the gloves. Hands
must be washed before donning gloves. Gloves must be discarded when soil or other
contaminants enter the inside of the glove.
Slash-resistant gloves are not easily cleaned and sanitized. Their use with ready-to-eat
foods could contaminate the food.
Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) Gloves
Natural rubber latex gloves have been reported to cause allergic reactions in some
individuals who wear latex gloves during food preparation, and even in individuals
eating food prepared by food employees wearing latex gloves (refer to Annex 2,
3-304.15). This information should be taken into consideration when deciding whether
single-use gloves made of latex will be used during food preparation.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
424
 









Although many allergic reactions occur as a result of occupational exposure, CFSAN is
actively reviewing its current policy on the use of disposable NRL gloves in food
operations in light of the possible transmission of the latex protein via food. To gain
additional information regarding allergic reactions allegedly due to the ingestion of food
contaminated by NRL in retail settings, CFSAN has been collecting reports of such
reactions from consumers who have contacted the Agency. Several offices within
CFSAN will continue to collaborate in reviewing incoming data. The results of these
activities and other related efforts will be used to determine if policy changes regarding
the use of latex in food operations, based on food safety considerations, are warranted.
The FDA, Office of Food Additive Safety, Division of Food Contact Notification, reviews
gloves submitted for food-contact use in the food industry on the basis of the glove’s
formulation or components. FDA regulates NRL gloves used for medical purposes only.
FDA is aware of the following information related to occupational hazards (not food
safety hazards) associated with the use of NRL gloves:
•	 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a 1997
Alert titled "Preventing Allergic Reactions to Natural Rubber Latex in the Workplace"
(NIOSH publication number 97-135) which is found at
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/97-135/.
•	 The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the
American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) issued a joint
statement discouraging the routine use of NRL gloves by food handlers. (1997)

3-304.16	 Using Clean Tableware for Second Portions
and Refills.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-304.11.
3-304.17 Refilling Returnables.
Food establishments may provide multi-use to-go containers to consumers with the
intention that the containers are to be returned to the food establishment for refilling or
reuse. These containers are likely to be soiled when the consumer returns the
container to the food establishment. As a result, pathogens may be transferred to food
by consumers or employees directly, or indirectly, from used take-home food
containers. The existing provisions in the Food Code, specifically the cleaning and
sanitization provisions in Parts 4-6 and 4-7, if carried out properly upon return of a used
container, are sufficient to ensure that the container is safe to refill or reuse if performed
in conjunction with a visual inspection by a food employee to verify that the container
still meets the intent of the provisions in Parts 4-1 and 4-2. Reusing single-service and
single-use articles is prohibited by the Food Code.
The refilling of consumer-owned, personal take-out beverage containers, such as
thermally insulated bottles, nonspill coffee cups, and promotional beverage glasses, by
a consumer or food employee introduces the possibility of contamination of the filling
equipment or product by improperly cleaned containers or the improper operation of the
equipment. To prevent this contamination and possible health hazards to the consumer,
the refilling of consumer-owned, personal take-out beverage containers is limited to
beverages that are not potentially hazardous (time/temperature control for safety)
foods. Equipment must be designed to prevent the contamination of the equipment and
means must be provided to clean the containers at the facility.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

Preventing
Contamination
from the
Premises
3-305.11 Food Storage.
3-305.12 Food Storage, Prohibited Areas.
Pathogens can contaminate and/or grow in food that is not stored properly. Drips of
condensate and drafts of unfiltered air can be sources of microbial contamination for
stored food. Shoes carry contamination onto the floors of food preparation and storage
areas. Even trace amounts of refuse or wastes in rooms used as toilets or for dressing,
storing garbage or implements, or housing machinery can become sources of food
contamination. Moist conditions in storage areas promote microbial growth.
3-305.13	 Vended Time/Temperature Control for Safety
Food, Original Container.
The possibility of product contamination increases whenever food is exposed.
Changing the container(s) for machine vended time/temperature control for safety food
allows microbes that may be present an opportunity to contaminate the food.
Pathogens could be present on the hands of the individual packaging the food, the
equipment used, or the exterior of the original packaging. In addition, time/temperature
control for safety foods are vended in a hermetically sealed state to ensure product
safety. Once the original seal is broken, the food is vulnerable to contamination.
3-305.14	 Food Preparation.
Food preparation activities may expose food to an environment that may lead to the
food's contamination. Just as food must be protected during storage, it must also be
protected during preparation. Sources of environmental contamination may include
splash from cleaning operations, drips form overhead air conditioning vents, or air from
an uncontrolled atmosphere such as may be encountered when preparing food in a
building that is not constructed according to Food Code requirements.
Preventing
Contamination
by Consumers
3-306.11 Food Display.
During display, food can be contaminated even when there is no direct hand contact.
Many microbes can be conveyed considerable distances on air currents through fine
sprays or aerosols. These may originate from people breathing or sneezing, water
sprays directed at drains, or condensate from air conditioners. Even wind gusts across
sewage deposits and fertilized fields have been known to contaminate food in adjacent
establishments where food was unprotected.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
427
 






3-306.12 Condiments, Protection.
Unpackaged condiments are exposed to contamination by consumers who could be
suffering from a disease transmissible through food. Once the condiments are
contaminated, subsequent consumers using the condiments may be exposed to
pathogens. Condiments in individual packages are protected from consumer
contamination.
On- or off-site facilities for refilling condiment dispensers must be adequately equipped
to ensure that the filling operation does not introduce contaminants.
3-306.13 Consumer Self-Service Operations.
Raw foods of animal origin usually contain pathogens. In addition, these foods, if
offered for consumer self-service, could cross contaminate other foods stored in the
same display. Because raw foods of animal origin are assumed to be contaminated
and do provide an ideal medium for the growth of pathogenic organisms, they should
not be available for consumer self-service. Self-service operations of ready-to-eat
foods also provide an opportunity for contamination by consumers. The risk of
contamination can be reduced by supplying clean utensils and dispensers and by
employee monitoring of these operations to ensure that the utensils and dispensers are
properly used.
Bean sprouts that are displayed in produce areas for consumer self-service are
time/temperature control for safety foods and appropriate refrigeration must be
maintained. However, they are not considered ready-to-eat since they are intended to
be washed by the consumer before consumption.
3-306.14 Returned Food and Re-Service or Sale.
Food can serve as a means of person-to-person transmission of disease agents such
as hepatitis A virus. Any unpackaged foods, even bakery goods in a bread basket that
are not time/temperature control for safety foods and that have been served to a
consumer, but not eaten, can become vehicles for transmitting pathogenic
microorganisms from the initial consumer to the next if the food is served again.
Preventing
Contamination

Sources
3-307.11 Miscellaneous Sources of Contamination.
This Code section provides a category in which to capture sources of contamination not
specifically delineated in Subparts 3-301 through 306. Codes prior to 1993 had such a
provision for addressing food contamination for reasons other than those elsewhere
specified. Regardless of its specificity, a Code can not anticipate all the diverse means
by which food can become contaminated after receipt.

Cooking 3-401.11 Raw Animal Foods.
3-401.12 Microwave Cooking.
3-401.13 Plant Food Cooking for Hot Holding.
Cooking, to be effective in eliminating pathogens, must be adjusted to a number of
factors. These include the anticipated level of pathogenic bacteria in the raw product,
the initial temperature of the food, and the food's bulk which affects the time to achieve
the needed internal product temperature. Other factors to be considered include postcooking heat rise and the time the food must be held at a specified internal
temperature.
Greater numbers and varieties of pathogens generally are found on poultry than on
other raw animal foods. Therefore, a higher temperature, in combination with the
appropriate time is needed to cook these products.
To kill microorganisms, food must be held at a sufficient temperature for the specified
time. Cooking is a scheduled process in which each of a series of continuous
time/temperature combinations can be equally effective. For example, in cooking a
beef roast, the microbial lethality achieved at 112 minutes after it has reached 54.4°C
(130°F) is the same lethality attained as if it were cooked for 4 minutes after it has
reached 62.8°C (145°F). Cooked beef and roast beef, including sectioned and formed
roasts, chunked and formed roasts, lamb roasts and cooked corned beef can be
prepared using one of the time and temperature combinations listed in the chart in
§ 3-401.11 to meet a 6.5-log10 reduction of Salmonella. The stated temperature is the
minimum that must be achieved and maintained in all parts of each piece of meat for a
least the stated time. The source of the time and temperature parameters is from the
USDA/FSIS Appendix A. Compliance Guidelines For Meeting Lethality Performance
Standards For Certain Meat And Poultry Products found at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/complianceguides-index/compliance-guides-index.
Cooking requirements are based in part on the biology of pathogens. The thermal
destruction of a microorganism is determined by its ability to survive heat. Different
species of microorganisms have different susceptibilities to heat. Also, the growing
stage of a species (such as the vegetative cell of bacteria, the trophozoite of protozoa,
or the larval form of worms) is less resistant than the same organism's survival form
(the bacterial spore, protozoan cyst, or worm egg).
Food characteristics also affect the lethality of cooking temperatures. Heat penetrates
into different foods at different rates. High fat content in food reduces the effective
lethality of heat. High humidity within the cooking vessel and the moisture content of
food aid thermal destruction.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
429
 







Heating a large roast too quickly with a high oven temperature may char or dry the
outside, creating a layer of insulation that shields the inside from efficient heat
penetration. To kill all pathogens in food, cooking must bring all parts of the food up to
the required temperatures for the correct length of time.
The temperature and time combination criteria specified in Part 3-4 of this Code are
based on the destruction of Salmonellae. This organism, if present in raw shell eggs, is
generally found in relatively low numbers. Other foods, uncomminuted fish and meats
including commercially raised game animal meat, specified as acceptable for cooking at
this temperature and time parameter are expected to have a low level of internal
contamination. The parameters are expected to provide destruction of the surface
contaminants on these foods. Part 3-4 includes temperature and time parameters that
provide "D" values (decimal log reduction values) that may surpass 7D. For example, at
63o
C(145o
F), a time span of 15 seconds will provide a 3D reduction of Salmonella
Enteritidis in eggs.
The requirements specified under ¶ 3-401.11(D) acknowledge the rights of an informed
consumer to order and consume foods as preferred by that consumer based on the
consumer’s health status and understanding of the risks associated with eating raw or
partially-cooked animal foods.
In consumer self-service operations, such as buffets, salad bars, sushi bars, or display
cases, the consumer advisory as specified under section 3-603.11 must be posted or
available at the self-service unit where the raw or partially cooked food is held for
service and readily accessible to consumers prior to making their food selections. In a
catered situation, such as a wedding reception, guests are responsible for making their
own requests or selections.
Slow-cooked roasts - Heating Deviations and Slow Come Up Time
(Source: USDA/FSIS Appendix A Compliance Guidelines For Meeting Lethality
Performance Standards For Certain Meat And Poultry Products found at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/complianceguides-index/compliance-guides-index.
Heating deviations, which most often involve slow come-up time or an inordinate dwell
time within the optimum temperature range for microorganism growth can foster the
multiplication of many pathogens. This multiplication sometimes can be so prodigious
that even recooking may be ineffective in rendering the product safe. Also, certain
toxigenic bacteria can release toxins into the product. Some of these toxins, such as
those of Staphylococcus aureus, are extremely heat stable and are not inactivated by
normal recooking temperatures.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
430
 







Further, the sampling of product following a heating deviation may not yield sufficient
information to determine the safety of the product in question. Heating deviations can
favor the multiplication of many types of bacteria. It would be difficult and expensive to
sample for all of them. Depending on the circumstances, establishments may want to
use computer modeling to estimate the relative multiplication of bacteria. For example,
in a past incident involving an extreme heating deviation, product was put in an oven in
which the temperature was inadvertently set to 95°F for about 12 hours. Computer
modeling was easily applied in this case because much of the dwell time was at one
temperature. The USDA/FSIS determined that within a 6-hour time frame (with other
growth conditions assumed to be favorable), the relative multiplication of many
pathogens of concern could have exceeded 5-logs. Clearly the product could not be
salvaged by reprocessing and was therefore destroyed. Under changing conditions of
temperature, however, computer modeling becomes more difficult. One approach is to
average lag/log times over small increments such as 5° and add these times to get an
approximation of possible total relative growth over a larger increment of time.
Establishments must keep in mind that the population of bacteria before processing is
generally unknown and that assumptions in the high range often are used as input
parameters in the modeling.
Seared Steak
The provision for allowing seared steaks was reviewed by the National Advisory
Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) and USDA. Paragraph
3-401.11(C) includes their recommendations.
USDA comments included, “For the purposes of this discussion, steak is a whole beef
muscle. It does not include whole beef muscle that has been pinned, injected, or
chopped and formed. It may be cut cross grain, such as sirloin, chuck, or porterhouse;
or it may be cut with the grain, such as flank, skirt, or Chateaubriand. Other species,
such as poultry, pork, and lamb are not included.”
NACMCF comments included, “Due to the low probability of pathogenic organisms
being present in or migrating from the external surface to the interior of beef muscle,
cuts of intact muscle (steaks) should be safe if the external surfaces are exposed to
temperatures sufficient to effect a cooked color change. In addition, the cut (exposed)
surfaces must receive additional heat to effect a complete sear across the cut surfaces.
Grill or char marks may be applied to the complete surface searing. The meat should
be seared on both top and bottom surfaces utilizing a heating environment (e.g., grill or
broiling oven) that imparts a temperature at the surface of the intact steak of at least
145o
F to achieve a cooked color change on all external surfaces. The searing of all
surfaces should be continuous until the desired degree of doneness and appearance
are attained. This is considered a ready-to-eat food.”
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
431
 









As reflected in the definition of “whole-muscle, intact beef steak,” marination is a food
safety concern when the fascia (exterior surface) of the steak is broken by scoring or
other means which allows the marinade to penetrate, and potentially contaminate, the
interior of the steak. In such cases, the Code allowance for undercooking without a
consumer advisory is negated.
Pork
In pork, Trichinella spiralis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Taenia solium, parasites
causing foodborne illness, are inactivated at temperatures below 145o
F. Therefore,
pork roasts can be cooked like beef roasts (e.g., 145o
F for 3 minutes) and pork chops
cooked like steaks to achieve an internal temperature of 145o
F for 15 seconds.
Based on the Goodfellow and Brown study, a 5D reduction of organisms is achieved at
68o
C (155o
F) for 15 seconds for the following foods: ratites and injected meats and
comminuted: fish, meat, game animals commercially raised for food, and game
animals that come under a USDA voluntary inspection program. Ratites such as
ostrich, emu, and rhea are included in this list of raw animals foods because when
cooked to a temperature greater than 68o
C (155o
F), ratites exhibit a (metallic) "off"
taste.
When USDA established the time and temperature parameters for 9 CFR 318.23 HeatProcessing and Stabilization Requirements for Uncurred Meat Patties (known as the
"patty rule"), the Agency based the 5D for Salmonella on extrapolations applied to the
research done by Goodfellow and Brown to account for the lack of a "come up, come
down" time in the thin, small mass beef patties. Consequently, there is no linear
relationship between the patty rule and roast beef time and temperature parameters.
The patty rule also provided for an 8D reduction in the number of Shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli. The time and temperature requirements in the Food Code for
comminuted meats are comparable to the USDA requirements.
Temperature for Comminuted Meat at Less Than 1 Second
In the "Report of the Task Force on Technical Issues Arising from the National Advisory
Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods” (NACMCF) Review of the Meat Patty
Proposal" (undated), it is stated on page 7, in Option (A), that:
“Based on the 1998 research data ... and an assumption that
instantaneous is defined as eight seconds, manufacturers would be
required to process fully-cooked meat patties at a temperature of 157o
F.
Given the lack of any significant margin of safety in this process, there
should be no deviation below the 158o
F requirement.”
In November, 1997, the NACMCF Meat and Poultry Subcommittee revisited the time
and temperatures for cooking hamburger and advised FDA that cooking hamburger to
158o
F for less than one second is an adequate cook based on the following:
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
432
 







1. The cooking recommendations contained in the Food Code and in
USDA guidance provide a large margin of safety for killing vegetative
enteric pathogens;
2. The concept of integrated lethality (the kill imparted during the entire
heating and cooling process) adds to the margin of safety; and
3. The time component of the time and temperature requirement will be
exceeded before the temperature can be determined.
The parameters for cooking poultry, wild game animal meats, stuffed food products,
etc., of 74o
C (165o
F) or above for 15 seconds yield greater than a 7D reduction.
Children’s Menu
The 2005 FDA Food Code Section 3-401.11 (D) “Raw Animal Foods” allows operators
to serve raw or partially cooked animal food items on their customer’s request, as long
as the establishment does not serve a “Highly Susceptible Population” and the
customer is informed of the risks associated with consuming undercooked items.
The definition of “Highly Susceptible Population” however, only includes young children
who are of pre-school age and who obtain food under custodial care (as from a child
daycare center). This definition does not address pre-school and older children eating
in retail food establishments (such as restaurants), where it is common practice to offer
menu items intended for children (e.g. “Kids Menu”).
The Food Code seeks to increase current protection of children beyond custodial care
facilities and establish needed safeguards in all retail food establishments. The
importance of this issue can be demonstrated for numerous combinations of raw animal
foods and associated pathogens. The greatest impact on children however, is
undercooked ground beef, where the specific organism of concern is Escherichia coli
O157:H7.
Children are at relatively high risk for infection with E.coli O157:H7. It is possibly the
leading cause of acute kidney failure and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in
children [10]. Infection with E. coli O157:H7 can result with mild to severe symptoms
such as: non-bloody or bloody diarrhea to HUS, which is a condition that includes
destruction of red blood cells, problems with blood clotting and kidney failure. About
2% to 20% of patients that are infected with E. coli O157:H7 develop HUS [6]. The risk
of illness from E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef has been shown to be about 2.5 times
higher for preschool children and infants than for the rest of the population [6]. The
CDC has reported the following E. coli 0157:H7 infection rates per 100,000 by age
range: 8.2 for young children 1-9 years old and 3.0 for older children 10-20 years of
age [4].
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
433
 







Precluding undercooked foods from being offered on a children’s menu may result in
increased protection to children from foodborne illness, particularly E. coli O157:H7,
which can result in severe consequences in children.
3-401.12 Microwave Cooking.
The rapid increase in food temperature resulting from microwave heating does not
provide the same cumulative time and temperature relationship necessary for the
destruction of microorganisms as do conventional cooking methods. In order to
achieve comparable lethality, the food must attain a temperature of 74o
C (165o
F) in all
parts of the food. Since cold spots may exist in food cooking in a microwave oven, it is
critical to measure the food temperature at multiple sites when the food is removed
from the oven and then allow the food to stand covered for two minutes post microwave
heating to allow thermal equalization and exposure. Although some microwave ovens
are designed and engineered to deliver energy more evenly to the food than others, the
important factor is to measure and ensure that the final temperature reaches 74o
C
(165o
F) throughout the food.
"The factors that influence microwave thermal processes include many of the same
factors that are important in conventional processes (mass of objects, shape of objects,
specific heat and thermal conductivity, etc.). However, other factors are unique in
affecting microwave heating, due to the nature of the electric field involved in causing
molecular friction. These factors are exemplified by moisture and salt contents of
foods, which play a far more important role in microwave than conventional heating."
(Reference: Heddelson and Doores, see Annex 2)
3-401.13 Plant Food Cooking for Hot Holding.
Fruits and vegetables that are fresh, frozen, or canned and that are heated for hot
holding need only to be cooked to the temperature required for hot holding. These
foods do not require the same level of microorganism destruction as do raw animal
foods since these fruits and vegetables are ready-to-eat at any temperature. Cooking
to the hot holding temperature of 57°C (135°F) prevents the growth of pathogenic
bacteria that may be present in or on these foods. In fact, the level of bacteria will be
reduced over time at the specified hot holding temperature.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
434
 





3-401.14 Non-Continuous Cooking of Raw Animal
Foods.
Close attention must be paid to control of biological hazards when a food establishment
cooks raw animal foods using a process in which the food is partially cooked then
cooled with the expectation of fully cooking the food at a later date or time. Section
3-401.14 requires that establishments wishing to use a non-continuous process for the
cooking of raw animal foods establish and follow a written plan that ensures each stage
of the process is completed within time and temperature parameters that adequately
prevent pathogen survival and growth. Section 3-401.14 also requires that
establishments take special precautions to ensure that raw animal foods that have only
been initially heated to temperatures that are not lethal to the pathogens of concern are
clearly identified so that they will not be inadvertently sold or served to the consumer in
a partially cooked state.
To ensure the food does not dwell for extended periods within temperature ranges that
favor pathogen growth, § 3-401.14 establishes limits on the time permitted to initially
heat the food (initial “come-up” time) and the time permitted to cool the product to
temperatures that are safe for refrigerated storage. Together, these limits should
prevent food from remaining at temperatures at which pathogen growth to harmful
levels may occur.
The criteria in § 3-401.14 were developed with consideration of the United States
Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS)
Performance Standards for Partially Cooked and Char-Marked Meat Patties and
Partially Cooked Poultry Breakfast Strips found in 9 CFR 318.23 and 9 CFR 381.150.
(http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/pdf/9cfr318.23.pdf,
http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_08/9cfr381_08.html)
The maximum one hour time limit for the initial heating stage was established based on
estimates from predictive microbial modeling. It is intended to limit the cumulative
growth of Clostridium perfringens that may occur during the come-up time and the
subsequent cooling of the product in accordance with the requirements in
¶ 3-501.14(A). Unless properly controlled, processes in which animal foods are heated
to sub-lethal temperatures and times and then cooled may create an environment for
the growth of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and other spore
forming, toxigenic bacteria.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
435
 

The product temperature achieved during the initial heating process may not be
sufficient to destroy vegetative cells of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium
perfringens, and Bacillus cereus, if present. The concern is the generation of a large
number of vegetative cells of Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium botulinum
before the final cooking stage. For Clostridium botulinum, if enough vegetative cells
are produced, toxigenesis can occur in the product before the product is fully cooked.
The toxin is not destroyed at the minimum required cooking temperatures. For
Clostridium perfringens, if a large number of vegetative cells are consumed, illness
can result. In either case a high number of vegetative cells may challenge the lethality
step of the ultimate cooking process to the extent that it will be unable to completely
eliminate all of these vegetative cells. The cumulative growth of these bacterial
pathogens must be taken into account during both the initial heating and cooling steps.
The hazard may be compounded with an extended initial “come-up” time and/or a
prolonged cooling stage. Hence the degree of hazard may be dependent upon the
ultimate effect of the initial heating and cooling, as well as the final cooking step.
A full and adequate cook during the final cooking step is of critical importance to ensure
destruction of any pathogens that may have survived and proliferated during any initial
heating and cooling stages of the non-continuous cooking process. Section 3-401.14
requires that animal foods cooked by a non-continuous cooking process achieve a
minimum final cook temperature that heats all parts of the food to a temperature and for
a time specified under ¶¶3-401.11 (A)-(C). This requirement also precludes serving
animal foods that have undergone non-continuous cooking in an undercooked or raw
state. In other words, animal foods cooked using a non-continuous process are not
covered in the exceptions provided for in ¶ 3-401.11(D) that allow for serving
undercooked animal foods upon consumer request and with an adequate consumer
advisory.
Section 3-401.14 requires that an establishment using non-continuous cooking
processes also establish procedures for identifying foods that have only been partially
cooked and cooled. This is necessary to ensure these foods are not mistaken by food
workers for foods that have been fully cooked and therefore ready-to-eat without a full
cook. Partially cooked foods may appear to be fully cooked.
Requiring that food establishments obtain prior approval by the regulatory authority
before employing non-continuous cooking processes will help to ensure that the
establishment has the proper procedures in place, as well as the necessary facilities
and capacity to monitor the appropriate cooling, cooking, separation and product
identification of the foods. in accordance with the requirements.

Freezing 3-402.11 Parasite Destruction.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-201.11.
Lightly cooked, raw, raw-marinated, and cold-smoked fish may be desired by
consumers for taste or perceived nutritional reasons. In order to ensure destruction of
parasites, fish may be frozen before service as an alternative public health control to
that which is provided by adequate cooking. Candling or other visual inspection
techniques are not adequate to avoid the risk of parasites from fish which have not
been frozen.
The recommended control strategies refer to the ambient air temperature during
freezing and to the length of time that the fish is held at the appropriate freezer
temperature, or the length of time that the fish is held after it is solid frozen, whichever it
appropriate. The parasite hazard is not considered to be reasonably likely to occur if
the finished product is fish eggs that have been removed from the skein (the tissue that
contains the egg mass) and rinsed.
In response to information provided to the FDA Office of Seafood, the Fish and
Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance lists certain species of tuna as not
being susceptible to parasites of concern and therefore exempted from the freezing
requirements that apply to other fish species that are consumed raw.
The Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance states that species
that normally have parasites as a result of consuming infected prey, apparently do not
have the same parasite hazard when raised on pelleted food in an aquaculture
operation. On the other hand, aquacultured fish that are fed processing waste and bycatch fish may have a parasite hazard, even when wild caught fish of that species do
not normally have a parasite hazard. Feed must not contain any live parasites. For
example, the use of fresh fish meat in feed could transmit such parasites. Only heat
treated feed or feed otherwise produced in a manner that would kill parasite
intermediate stages infective to the aquacultured fish, such as most pelleted feeds,
should be used.
Additionally, it should be noted that the Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and
Controls Guidance, Edition 4, Tables 3-2 and 3-3 (Chapter 3) lists those species for
which FDA has information that a potential parasite hazard exists. Fish species in
Tables 3-2 and 3-3 that do not have specific parasite hazards listed are not necessarily
safe when consumed raw or undercooked. This is because fish species in Tables 3-2
and 3-3 were not listed with a parasite hazard if the species were generally cooked
before consumption. In addition, in some cases, there is insufficient information or data
to be able to denote a specific parasite hazard or deem the species as naturally
parasite-free. The exemptions to freezing as specified in ¶ 3-402.11(B) of the Food
Code are inclusive of and in harmony with the information and recommendations
provided in the Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

Based on FDA’s current assessment, parasites are not considered a significant hazard
in molluscan shellfish or in scallop products consisting only of the shucked abductor
muscle. Therefore these products are not required to be subject to the parasite
destruction procedures specified under ¶3-402.11(A) prior to sale or service in a raw or
partially cooked form.

destruction procedures specified under ¶3-402.11(A) prior to sale or service in a raw or

3-402.12 Records, Creation and Retention.
Records must be maintained to verify that the critical limits required for food safety are
being met. Records provide a check for both the operator and the regulator in
determining that monitoring and corrective actions have taken place.
While the Country of Origin Labeling requirements, http://www.ams.usda.gov/COOL/
effective Sept. 30, 2004, mandate identification of wild and farm-raised fish and
shellfish, the requirements do not address contents of pelleted feed used in the
aquaculture operation. Documentation must be available in the food establishment
from the source-through-purchase specifications or labeling that pelleted feed used did
not contain fresh fish or plankton. Follow the guidance provided in the Fish and
Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance, Table #3-1 – Potential Vertebrate
Species Related Hazards and Table #3-2 – Potential Invertebrate Species Related
Hazards.
Reheating 3-403.11 Reheating for Hot Holding.
When food is held, cooled, and reheated in a food establishment, there is an increased
risk from contamination caused by personnel, equipment, procedures, or other factors.
If food is held at improper temperatures for enough time, pathogens have the
opportunity to multiply to dangerous numbers. Proper reheating provides a major
degree of assurance that pathogens will be eliminated. It is especially effective in
reducing the numbers of Clostridium perfringens that may grow in meat, poultry, or
gravy if these products were improperly cooled. Vegetative cells of C. perfringens can
cause foodborne illness when they grow to high numbers. Highly resistant
C. perfringens spores will survive cooking and hot holding. If food is abused by being
held at improper holding temperatures or improperly cooled, spores can germinate to
become rapidly multiplying vegetative cells.
Although proper reheating will kill most organisms of concern, some toxins such as that
produced by Staphylococcus aureus, cannot be inactivated through reheating of the
food. It is imperative that food contamination be minimized to avoid this risk.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
438
 










The potential for growth of pathogenic bacteria is greater in reheated cooked foods than
in raw foods. This is because spoilage bacteria, which inhibit the growth of pathogens
by competition on raw product, are killed during cooking. Subsequent recontamination
will allow pathogens to grow without competition if temperature abuse occurs.
Shelf-stable, commercially prepared ready-to eat foods in hermetically sealed
containers will have received a controlled retort process that destroys all bacterial
pathogens, both vegetative cells and spores, to provide a commercially sterile product.
Refrigerated, commercially processed, ready-to-eat, TCS food will have received
controlled thermal processing that destroys vegetative bacterial cells and a controlled
cooling process that prevents the germination of any spores present. Packaging
prevents recontamination and refrigeration prevents spore germination. Because there
is limited risk of contamination in these types of products, reheating such foods to the
minimum hot holding temperature of 135°F is considered adequate when reheating for
hot holding. This should be the case for product that remains in the container or
package after it is opened, provided the proper steps are taken to protect the remaining
portions from contamination and they are maintained at the appropriate cold holding
temperatures as specified in the Food Code.

Temperature and
Time Control
3-501.11 Frozen Food.
3-501.12 Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food,
 Slacking.
3-501.13 Thawing.
Freezing prevents microbial growth in foods, but usually does not destroy all
microorganisms. Improper thawing provides an opportunity for surviving bacteria to
grow to harmful numbers and/or produce toxins. If the food is then refrozen, significant
numbers of bacteria and/or all preformed toxins are preserved.
ROP Fish
Retailers should be aware that when a manufacturer packages fish and fishery
products a hazard analysis is required under 21 CFR Parts 123 and 1240, Procedures
for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and Importing of Fish and Fishery Products (the
Seafood HACCP Rule) to provide for control for nonproteolytic C. botulinum. Factors
that make formation of C. botulinum toxin reasonably likely to occur during finished
product storage and distribution are those that may result from the use of a reduced
oxygen packaging (ROP) environment in a food that does not contain barriers to growth
of C. botulinum.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
439
 








The processing control for C. botulinum can be either freezing, refrigeration alone or
refrigeration in combination with chemical inhibitors, (e.g. salt, water activity control).
The Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Control Guidance, Fourth Edition, Chapter
13, addresses freezing as a control strategy for frozen product. This control is intended
to prevent exposure of the product to conditions conducive to the production of toxin by
nonproteolytic strains of C. botulinum in the closed ROP package.
If freezing was chosen by the manufacturer as the barrier to control for nonproteolytic
strains of C. botulinum, then each individual package of the ROP fish should be labeled
to be kept frozen and thawed according to the manufacturer’s label instructions.
Typically ROP fish will come into retail food establishments in a frozen state with a label
that indicates to “thaw immediately before use” or indicates that the product needs to be
“kept frozen, and thawed under refrigeration immediately before use.”
If a “Keep Frozen” label is not present on each individual ROP package unit, it may or
may not be acceptable to store under refrigeration, depending in part on whether there
are barriers such as pH or water activity to growth of C botulinum in addition to
refrigeration.
As an added safeguard to prevent the possibility of C. botulinum toxin formation, the
Food Code requires that any frozen ROP fish that does not have barriers to growth of
C. botulinum in addition to refrigeration be completely removed from the ROP
environment or package prior to thawing. This is to discourage the practice of thawing
frozen ROP fish and holding it at 41ºF or less for a prolonged time period and/or selling
it as a refrigerated product.
3-501.14 Cooling.
Safe cooling requires removing heat from food quickly enough to prevent microbial
growth. Excessive time for cooling of time/temperature control for safety foods has
been consistently identified as one of the leading contributing factors to foodborne
illness. During slow cooling, time/temperature control for safety foods are subject to the
growth of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. A longer time near ideal bacterial
incubation temperatures, 21o
C - 52o
C (70o
F - 125o
F), is to be avoided. If the food is not
cooled in accordance with this Code requirement, pathogens may grow to sufficient
numbers to cause foodborne illness.
The Food Code provision for cooling provides for cooling from 135ºF to 41°F or 45°F in
6 hours, with cooling from 135ºF to 70°F in 2 hours. The 6-hour cooling parameter, with
an initial 2-hour rapid cool, allows for greater flexibility in meeting the Code. The initial
2-hour cool is a critical element of this cooling process. An example of proper cooling
might involve cooling from 135ºF to 70ºF in 1 hour, in which case 5 hours remain for
cooling from 70ºF to 41ºF or 45ºF. Conversely, if cooling from 135ºF to 41°F or 45°F is
achieved in 6 hours, but the initial cooling to 70ºF took 3 hours, the food safety hazards
may not be adequately controlled.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
440
 









If the cooking step prior to cooling is adequate and no recontamination occurs, all but
the spore-forming organisms such as Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus cereus
should be killed or inactivated. However, under substandard sanitary conditions, other
pathogens such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes may be reintroduced.
Thus, cooling requirements are based on growth characteristics of organisms that may
survive or be a post-cook contaminate and grow rapidly under temperature abuse
conditions.
Shell Eggs
FDA has approved the use of ionizing radiation for shell eggs. This approval means
that FDA has not found the ionizing radiation process to be unsafe for shell eggs.
However, shell eggs that have been subjected to the approved ionizing radiation
process are not considered to have been pasteurized. Shell egg pasteurization
requires the egg to have been subjected to a 5-log kill process for Salmonella
Enteritidis, while the approved ionizing radiation process may deliver only 2 or 3 logs
reduction. Therefore, eggs treated by ionizing radiation process alone must be held
under refrigeration, as it cannot be guaranteed that Salmonella Enteritidis will be
eliminated in all treated eggs. Further, irradiated eggs must be labeled in accordance
with 21 CFR 179.26 Ionizing radiation for the treatment of food.
Hard-boiled eggs with shell intact may be cooled in ambient air and are not considered
to be a time/temperature control for safety food after cooling. Hard-boiled eggs may be
cooled in drinking water but are considered to be a time/temperature control for safety
food after cooling because pathogens, which may be present in the water, may pass
through the egg shell during cooling.
Salmonella Enteritidis has been shown to have an extended lag phase in shell eggs
due to inhibitory characteristics of the albumen. Research indicates that the organisms
are physically located near the exterior of the yolk membrane, in contact with the
bacteriostatic components. Growth does not appear until the yolk membrane is
weakened by age or physically breached and the yolk nutrients, such as iron, become
available to the organisms.
Federal regulations effective August 27, 1999, require shell eggs to be transported and
distributed under refrigeration at an ambient temperature not to exceed 45°F. Packed
shell eggs must be labeled indicating that refrigeration is required. Imported shell eggs
packed for consumer use are required to include a certification that the eggs, at all
times after packing, have been stored and transported at an ambient temperature of no
greater than 45°F.
On December 5, 2000 federal regulations were amended to require that shell egg
cartons bear safe handling instructions and be placed under refrigeration at 45°F or
lower upon delivery at retail establishments (65 FR 76091, December 5, 2000, Food
Labeling, Safe Handling Statements, Labeling of Shell Eggs; Refrigeration of Shell
Eggs Held for Retail Distribution). The amended provisions include:
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
441
 




•	 21 CFR Part 16 Regulatory Hearing before the Food and Drug Administration,
§ 16.5 Inappplicability and limited applicability, (4) A hearing on an order for relabeling, diversion or destruction of shell eggs…
•	 21 CFR Part 101 Food Labeling § 101.17 Food labeling warning, notice, and
safe handling statements, (h) Shell eggs.
•	 21 CFR Part 115 Shell Eggs, § 115.50 Refrigeration of shell eggs held for retail
distribution.
Shell eggs must be placed immediately after receipt in refrigerated equipment that is
capable of maintaining an ambient air temperature of 45°F. With the newly established
Federal requirement for eggs to be in an ambient storage and transportation
temperature of 45°F, and with refrigeration of eggs at retail as described above, the
overall time that eggs are stored at temperatures that allow the growth of Salmonella
spp. should be shortened. Additionally, this requirement negates the need to "cool"
shell eggs upon receipt, although food establishment operators should maximize the
circulation of cooled air in refrigeration units by separating flats, cases, and multiple
cartons of eggs.
CFSAN/FSIS Joint Position Paper on Cooling
The processing of most ready-to-eat products includes a heat treatment or cooking step
to eliminate pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. However, this heat treatment
does not eliminate spores of Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens
and other spore-forming bacteria. Furthermore, these organisms can thrive in the warm
product since other competing organisms have been eliminated. Non-refrigerated,
anaerobic conditions are conducive to their growth and multiplication.
To prevent the growth and multiplication of spore-forming organisms, product should be
cooled rapidly after cooking. When there is inadequate cooling, spores can germinate
and the resulting vegetative cells can multiply to hazardous levels. The presence of
sufficient numbers of C. botulinum or other spore-forming organisms may lead to
production of harmful toxins. Therefore, ensuring no growth of these organisms will
provide the greatest amount of safety.
The USDA/FSIS Performance Standards for the Production of Certain Meat and Poultry
Products require a stabilization step (cooling) after the lethality step. The stabilization
requirements allow for no growth of C. botulinum and no more than 1 log growth of
C. perfringens. The performance standard of no more than 1 log growth of
C. perfringens was based on the following reasons:
1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested viable counts of
105 or greater of C. perfringens per gram as one of the criteria for incriminating
C. perfringens as a causative agent of foodborne illness in finished product.
However, foods responsible for C. perfringens outbreaks were found usually to
contain 106 vegetative C. perfringens cells per gram.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
442
 


In FSIS microbiological raw product surveys, samples were found to contain more
than 1000 C. perfringens per gram. There is some probability that greater than
104 C. perfringens per gram can occur in the raw product on rare occasions. It is a
conservative assumption that the great majority of C. perfringens in the raw product
are spores.
2. Heating activates spores that, during cooling, become vegetative cells that can
multiply to hazardous levels. If there are more than 104 C. perfringens (spores) per
gram on raw product, it is possible that there may be more than 104 vegetative
C. perfringens per gram in the product if it is improperly cooled after cooking.
3. Based on the CDC recommended upper limit of 105 which should not be exceeded,
it was determined that a limit of no more than 1 log10 growth of C. perfringens
would be appropriate to ensure that there would be no more than 105
C. perfringens per gram on the finished product after cooling.
4. The performance standard was discussed with experts on clostridia research. The
experts agreed that limiting the relative growth of C. perfringens to no more than
1 log10 would be reasonable and somewhat conservative with respect to product
safety. (64 FR 732, January 6, 1999, Performance Standards for the Production of
Certain Meat and Meat Products).
The FSIS compliance guideline for the cooling performance standards, which can be
found at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatorycompliance/compliance-guides-index/compliance-guides-index. Compliance Guidelines
for Cooling Heat-Treated Meat and Poultry Products (Stabilization), is that product must
be cooled from 130ºF to 80°F in 1.5 hours and from 80ºF to 40°F in 5 hours. This
cooling rate can be applied universally to cooked products like partially cooked or fully
cooked, intact or non-intact meat and poultry products. The guideline results in
continuous and rapid cooling of the product in the temperature range where the sporeforming organisms can grow rapidly.
The former USDA guideline of cooling from 120ºF to 55°F in no more than 6 hours is
also included in the new compliance guidelines. In using this guideline, chilling should
begin within 90 minutes after the cooking cycle is completed, and cooling should
continue until product reaches 40°F. The 6-hour rule begins when the product reaches
120ºF, and product should not be shipped until the product reaches 40°F. This older
cooling guideline results in a significantly smaller margin of safety, especially if the
product is non-intact. In using this older guideline, the establishment has to ensure that
cooling is as rapid as possible, especially between 120ºF and 80°F, and should monitor
the cooling closely to prevent any deviation. If product remains between these
temperatures for more than an hour, compliance with the performance standard is less
certain.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
443
 






The FSIS cooling guideline for meat and poultry products containing 100 ppm
added nitrite is 130ºF to 80°F in 5 hours and from 80ºF to 45°F in 10 hours, a total of
15 hours cooling time. This cooling process provides a narrow margin of safety. In
case of cooling deviations, the establishment should assume that their process has
exceeded the performance standard for controlling the growth of C. perfringens, and
should take corrective action. However, the presence of nitrite should ensure
compliance with the performance standard for C. botulinum.
The Food Code provision for cooling is similar, though not identical to the FSIS cooling
compliance guidelines. It provides for cooling from 135ºF to 70°F in 2 hours and from
135ºF to 41°F or 45°F in 6 hours and is based on the same food safety concerns as
FSIS’ guidance. The Food Code provides prescriptive cooling time/temperature
combinations without a HACCP plan in place. Federally inspected meat and poultry
establishments are required to implement a HACCP plan for their operations.
The Conference for Food Protection (CFP) at its 2000 meeting recommended that FSIS
and FDA ask the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods
(NACMCF) to review the data on safe cooling times for cooked, time/temperature
control for safety foods. The review would include data from a study, submitted to the
CFP, showing that cooling of a meat product from 130ºF to 45°F can safely take place
in 15 hours based on a study by V.K. Juneja, et al., 1994. According to the authors of
the study, continuous cooling of a meat product from 130ºF to 45°F in 15 hours
permitted about 1 log growth of C. perfringens.
In response to the CFP recommendation, the FSIS Administrator and CFSAN agreed
that the data referenced in the CFP recommendation do not support a change in the
FSIS guidance or the Food Code § 3-501.14 and considered it inadvisable to ask the
NACMCF to undertake the task requested for several reasons:
1. The study did not address growth of C. botulinum.
2. The results are from a carefully controlled laboratory study in which cooling of the
product was steady and continuous, conditions difficult to maintain in most
commercial processing or retail environments even with data loggers and other
control mechanisms in place.
3. The study was done only on ground beef and may not be applicable to other meat
and poultry or to other time/temperature control for safety foods.
As an alternative response, CFSAN and FSIS advised CFP that they would provide this
written position paper to clarify their joint position on the cooling issues.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
444
 



3-501.15 Cooling Methods.
Large food items, such as roasts, turkeys, and large containers of rice or refried beans,
take longer to cool because of the mass and volume from which heat must be removed.
By reducing the volume of the food in an individual container, the rate of cooling is
dramatically increased and opportunity for pathogen growth is minimized. If the hot
food container is tightly covered, the rate of heat transfer is reduced, i.e., the time
required for cooling and the time the food is exposed to optimal temperatures for
bacterial multiplication or toxin production are increased.
Alternatives to conventional methods include avoiding the need to cool larger masses
by preparing smaller batches closer to periods of service or chilling while stirring hot
food in containers within an ice water bath. Commercial refrigeration equipment is
designed to hold cold food temperatures, not cool large masses of food. Rapid chilling
equipment is designed to cool the food to acceptable temperatures quickly by using
very low temperatures and high rates of air circulation.
3-501.16	 Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food,
Hot and Cold Holding.
Bacterial growth and/or toxin production can occur if time/temperature control for safety
food remains in the temperature "Danger Zone" of 5o
C to 57o
C (41o
F to 135o
F) too
long. Up to a point, the rate of growth increases with an increase in temperature within
this zone. Beyond the upper limit of the optimal temperature range for a particular
organism, the rate of growth decreases. Operations requiring heating or cooling of food
should be performed as rapidly as possible to avoid the possibility of bacterial growth.
Cold Holding
Maintaining TCS foods under the cold temperature control requirements prescribed in
this code will limit the growth of pathogens that may be present in or on the food and
may help prevent foodborne illness. All microorganisms have a defined temperature
range in which they grow, with a minimum, maximum, and optimum. An understanding
of the interplay between time, temperature, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors is
crucial to selecting the proper storage conditions for a food product. Temperature has
dramatic impact on both the generation time of an organism and its lag period.
When considering growth rate of microbial pathogens, time and temperature are
integral and must be considered together. Increases in storage and/or display
temperature will decrease the shelf life of refrigerated foods since the higher the
temperature, the more permissive conditions are for growth.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
445
 







The exception for holding time/temperature control for safety food in specially designed
dispensing equipment recognizes technology designs that maintain the safety of
aseptically-packaged fluid foods when the equipment is manufactured and operated in
conformance with the NSF/ANSI Standard No. 18. NSF/ANSI 18 was revised in 2006,
with FDA input, to address the storage of certain types of time/temperature for safety
food or beverages in dispensing equipment without temperature control. The key
condition for FDA allowing this exemption from 3-501.16 is that the equipment conforms
to the requirements as specified in NSF/ANSI 18.
Except for raw shell eggs, control of the growth of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is the
basis for the list of cold holding temperature and time combinations in paragraph
3-501.17(A). The list addresses time, in addition to temperature, as a control for the
growth of Lm in refrigerated, ready-to-eat, time/temperature control for safety food. The
Code provisions for cold holding focus on environmental conditions that allow 1 log of
growth of Lm, and do not set an acceptable number of Lm in food. Neither do they
imply that Lm is in the product.
The times and temperatures in the 1999 Food Code were based on the USDA
Pathogen Modeling Program (PMP), which is conservative in estimating how soon Lm
begins to grow and how fast. The PMP was based largely on observations of microbial
growth in broth cultures, but some observations in specific foods were also included.
The PMP allows for some variation in temperature, pH, and water activity, and gives a
conservative estimate of safe times and temperatures for holding foods. The 1999
Food Code estimated safe times and temperatures that would allow 3 logs of growth,
based on the PMP.
During 2000, CFSAN researched published literature and compiled a listing of the
growth potential of Lm in various food commodities using real food data. Based on this
information, the 1999 Food Code times and temperatures of 41ºF for 7 days and 45ºF
for 4 days were validated, but the underlying performance standard changed for the
commodities studied. The research-based, food-specific times and temperatures allow
no more than 1 log of growth instead of the 3 log growth predicted in the PMP. This
more stringent performance standard of 1 log is consistent with the USDA/FSIS
performance standard and the fact that the infectious dose of Lm remains unknown.
FDA concluded that the 1999 Code time/temperature criteria hold true and provide both
a greater level of safety and a more realistic basis for regulatory requirements without
compromising public health protection.
In October 2003, FDA, in cooperation with the USDA/FSIS and CDC, released the
Quantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to Public Health from Foodborne Listeria
monocytogenes Among Selected Categories of Ready-to-Eat Foods (risk assessment)
at
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/RiskAssessment
SafetyAssessment/UCM197329.pdf.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
446
 





This initiative included the development of 23 separate risk assessments and analysis
of the relative risks of serious illness and death associated with consumption of 23
categories of ready-to-eat foods. These categories included: seafood, produce, meats,
dairy products, and deli salads.
The risk assessment identified several broad factors that affect consumer exposure to
Lm at the time of food consumption. Two of these factors, refrigerated storage
temperature and duration of refrigerated storage before consumption, have a direct
bearing on cold holding time/temperature combinations used in food establishments.
FDA continues to have concerns about the potential for growth of Lm in refrigerated,
ready-to-eat, time/temperature control for safety food, prepared and packaged in a food
processing plant and held in a food establishment. Data from the risk assessment (see
the following Annex 3, 3-501.16, Table 1) show a significant reduction in the projected
cases of listeriosis when refrigerated storage is limited to 41ºF. Based on these data
and conclusions from the risk assessment, FDA continues to recommend that food
establishments limit the cold storage of time/temperature control for safety foods,
ready-to-eat foods to a maximum temperature of 41ºF.

Regarding shell eggs, USDA published a final rule (63 FR 45663, August 27, 1998
Refrigeration and Labeling Requirements for Shell Eggs) to require that shell eggs
packed for consumer use be stored and transported at an ambient temperature not to
exceed 7ºC (45ºF). This regulation, however, does not apply to eggs while held at all
retail establishments.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
447
 


FDA is concerned that without continued refrigeration up until the time that the eggs are
cooked, there would be an opportunity for the egg's defenses to degrade and growth of
Salmonella Enteritidis to occur. The agency reviewed research indicating that
Salmonella Enteritidis multiplies at temperatures of 10ºC (50ºF) and above but can be
inhibited at lower temperatures, e.g., 8ºC (46ºF), 7ºC (45ºF), and 4ºC (39ºF). Based on
this research and USDA's temperature requirement during transport, FDA implemented
regulations that establish a maximum ambient air temperature of 7ºC (45ºF) for eggs
stored and displayed at retail establishments. Amended Federal regulations 21 CFR
Part 115.50 issued on December 5, 2000 and became effective on June 4, 2001.
Although Congress did not expressly preempt State law in this area, FDA found
preemption is needed because State and local laws that are less stringent than the
Federal requirements will not support the important public health goals of these
regulations. FDA does not believe that preemption of State and local refrigeration and
labeling requirements that are the same as or more stringent than the requirements of
these regulations is necessary, as enforcement of such State and local requirements
will support the food safety goals of these regulations. Accordingly, the preemptive
effect of this rule is limited to State or local requirements that are not as stringent as the
requirements of these regulations; requirements that are the same as or more stringent
than FDA's requirements remain in effect.
Historical Record of Cold Holding Temperature Provisions
The 1976 Food Service Sanitation Manual recommended 45°F as the cold holding
temperature. Based on the available science at the time, the 1993 Food Code lowered
the cold holding temperature to 41°F.
However, stakeholders raised concerns that many of the refrigerators currently in place
in food establishments would not be capable of maintaining food at that temperature.
There was also concern that most of the open-top buffet and food prep table-type units
being built at the time could not reliably maintain food at 41°F or less. Industry pointed
out that operators needed to recover investments in new refrigeration equipment
purchased just before or after a state adopted the 41°F provision.
Consequently, the Conference of Food Protection (CFP) recommended the 1997 Food
Code incorporate the option of having a 5-year phase-in period for the 41°F
requirement to allow for upgrading of existing equipment, and the FDA agreed.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
448
 


By 2006, many states adopted and implemented the phase-in period, the 5 years had
expired and they were requiring cold holding at 41°F or less. In addition, NSF/ANSI
Standard 7 was revised in 1997 and again in 1999 to ensure that equipment conforming
to the Standard, including open-top and display units, could achieve the desired
performance under conditions typically found in the food service and retail
environments. Thus, there are mechanisms in place to allow industry flexibility in
holding foods out of temperature control and the exemption for holding at 45°F was no
longer necessary, given equipment capabilities, existing provisions of the Food Code
that could be utilized (e.g., variances, time as a public health control), and the impact
on public health. Additionally, the FDA believed this exemption was no longer
necessary and perhaps was detrimental to public health protection in light of what had
been learned about the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in
refrigerated foods.
In 2006, the CFP recommended (CFP Issue 2006-I-033) and FDA agreed that the
option of maintaining 45°F as a cold holding temperature be deleted from § 3-501.16. In
the Supplement to the 2005 Food Code, the option to maintain 45°F as the cold holding
temperature was deleted from the Food Code and 41°F became the standard for cold
holding.
Hot Holding
In a January 2001 report, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria
for Foods (NACMCF) recommended that the minimum hot holding temperature
specified in the Food Code:
•	 Be greater than the upper limit of the range of temperatures at which Clostridium

perfringens and Bacillus cereus may grow; and
•	 Provide a margin of safety that accounts for variations in food matrices, variations

in temperature throughout a food product, and the capability of hot holding

equipment to consistently maintain product at a desired target temperature.

C. perfringens has been reported to grow at temperatures up to 52°C (126°F). Growth
at this upper limit requires anaerobic conditions and follows a lag phase of at least
several hours. The literature shows that lag phase duration and generation times are
shorter at incubation temperatures below 49°C (120°F) than at 52°C (125°F). Studies
also suggest that temperatures that preclude the growth of C. perfringens also
preclude the growth of B. cereus.
CDC estimates that approximately 250,000 foodborne illness cases can be attributed to
C. perfringens and B. cereus each year in the United States. These spore-forming
pathogens have been implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks associated with foods
held at improper temperatures. This suggests that preventing the growth of these
organisms in food by maintaining adequate hot holding temperatures is an important
public health intervention.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

Taking into consideration the recommendations of NACMCF and the 2002 Conference
for Food Protection meeting, FDA believes that maintaining food at a temperature of
57°C (135°F) or greater during hot holding is sufficient to prevent the growth of
pathogens and is therefore an effective measure in the prevention of foodborne illness.
3-501.17 Ready-to-Eat, Time/Temperature Control for
Safety Food, Date Marking.
3-501.18 Ready-to-Eat, Time/Temperature Control for
Safety Food, Disposition.
Refer to Annex 7, Chart 4-C.
Refrigeration prevents food from becoming a hazard by significantly slowing the growth
of most microbes. The growth of some bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, is
significantly slowed but not stopped by refrigeration. Over a period of time, this and
similar organisms may increase their risk to public health in ready-to-eat foods.
Based on a predictive growth curve modeling program for Listeria monocytogenes,
ready-to-eat, time/temperature control for safety food may be kept at 5o
C (41o
F) a total
of 7 days. Food which is prepared and held, or prepared, frozen, and thawed must be
controlled by date marking to ensure its safety based on the total amount of time it was
held at refrigeration temperature, and the opportunity for Listeria monocytogenes to
multiply, before freezing and after thawing. Time/temperature control for safety
refrigerated foods must be consumed, sold or discarded by the expiration date.
Date marking is the mechanism by which the Food Code requires active managerial
control of the temperature and time combinations for cold holding. Industry must
implement a system of identifying the date or day by which the food must be consumed,
sold, or discarded. Date marking requirements apply to containers of processed food
that have been opened and to food prepared by a food establishment, in both cases if
held for more than 24 hours, and while the food is under the control of the food
establishment. This provision applies to both bulk and display containers. It is not the
intent of the Food Code to require date marking on the labels of consumer size
packages.
A date marking system may be used which places information on the food, such as on
an overwrap or on the food container, which identifies the first day of preparation, or
alternatively, may identify the last day that the food may be sold or consumed on the
premises. A date marking system may use calendar dates, days of the week, colorcoded marks, or other effective means, provided the system is disclosed to the
Regulatory Authority upon request, during inspections.

FDA/USDA/CDC Listeria monocytogenes Risk Assessment
In September, 2003, FDA, in cooperation with USDA/FSIS and CDC, released the
Quantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to Public Health from Foodborne Listeria
monocytogenes Among Selected Categories of Ready-to-Eat Foods at
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/RiskAssessment
SafetyAssessment/UCM197329.pdf. This initiative included the development of 23
separate risk assessments and analysis of the relative risks of serious illness and death
associated with consumption of 23 categories of ready-to-eat foods. These categories
included: seafood, produce, meats, dairy products, and deli salads.
In examining these closely, FDA showed that 5 factors are important in measuring the
public health impact to consumers from foodborne listeriosis. These factors are:
(1) amounts and frequency of consumption of a ready-to-eat food; (2) frequency and
levels of L. monocytogenes in a ready-to-eat food; (3) potential of the food to support
growth of the bacterium during refrigeration; (4) refrigerated storage temperature; and
(5) duration of refrigerated storage before consumption.
Based on these 5 factors, the 23 categories of ready-to-eat foods were ranked
according to their relative risk of contamination and growth of Listeria
monocytogenes. The risk categories used were: very high risk; high risk; moderate
risk; low risk; and very low risk.
Impact of the Listeria monocytogenes Risk Assessment on Date Marking
Based on the results of the risk assessment and the recommendations from the
2004 Conference for Food Protection meeting, it was necessary to re-evaluate
date marking in an effort to focus the provision on very high and high risk foods,
while at the same time, exempting foods that present a very low, or low risk of
contamination and growth of Listeria monocytogenes. Based on this evaluation,
date marking provisions of the Food Code do not apply to the following foods:
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
451
 



Deli Salads Prepared and Packaged in a Food Processing Plant
Examples of deli salads include ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, seafood
salad, pasta salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad, manufactured according to
21 CFR 110. According to data from the risk assessment, deli salads prepared
and packaged by a food processing plant contain sufficient acidity, along with the
addition of preservatives (e.g., sorbate, benzoates), to prevent the growth of
Listeria monocytogenes. There are estimates that 85% of all deli salads are
prepared and packaged in a food processing plant and do not support growth.
Based on discussions with deli salad manufacturers and trade associations, it is a
nearly universal practice for food processing plants preparing and packaging deli
salads to add one or more preservatives that inhibit the growth of Listeria
monocytogenes. Based on their wide use within this segment of the industry and
their effectiveness at inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, all deli
salads prepared and packaged in a food processing plant are exempt from date
marking. However, all deli salads prepared in a food establishment require date
marking.
Hard and Semi-Soft Cheeses
In December, 1999, FDA issued an exemption from date marking for certain types
of hard and semi-soft cheeses
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandR
egulatoryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm113942.htm), based on the
presence of several factors that may control the growth of Listeria
monocytogenes. These factors may include organic acids, preservatives,
competing microorganisms, pH, water activity, or salt concentration. The results of
the risk assessment support this interpretation and therefore, hard and semi-soft
cheeses each manufactured according to 21 CFR 133 are exempt from date
marking.

Cultured Dairy Products
Cultured dairy products include yogurt, sour cream, and buttermilk, each
manufactured according to 21 CFR 131. Many of these products often are low pH
foods manufactured with lactic acid fermentation. Data from the risk assessment
show that Listeria monocytogenes does not grow in these foods and therefore,
these products are exempt from date marking.
Preserved Fish Products
Preserved fish products include pickled herring and dried, or salted cod, and other
acidified fish products, manufactured according to 21 CFR 114. Data from the risk
assessment show that the high salt and/or acidity of these products does not allow
for the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and therefore, these products are
exempt from date marking. This exemption does not apply to hot or cold smoked
fish products, nor does it apply to fish products that are dried, marinated, or
otherwise preserved on-site, in a food establishment, such as ceviche.
Shellstock
Although Listeria monocytogenes has been isolated from shellstock there have been
no reported Listeriosis cases linked to the consumption of this product at retail. The
competitive microflora present in and on shellstock inhibits the growth of Listeria
monocytogenes to harmful levels when the product is held under refrigeration at retail.
Therefore shelllstock are exempt from date marking.
USDA-regulated products
Date marking provisions of the Food Code do not apply to shelf stable ready-to-eat meat
and poultry products. Shelf stable ready-to-eat meat and poultry products are not required
by USDA to be labeled “Keep Refrigerated.” For these products, the nitrite and salt in the
cure and the lower pH resulting from fermentation give additional protection against
microbial growth. Some fermented sausages and salt-cured products are shelf stable, do
not require refrigeration, and do not bear the label “Keep Refrigerated.” To be shelf stable,
a product manufactured under USDA inspection must have a process that results in a
product that meets one of the recognized objective criteria for shelf stability, such as water
activity, moisture-protein ratio (MPR), or combination of MPR and pH (acidity). Therefore
they are exempt from the Food Code date marking requirements.
Shelf stable fermented sausages such as pepperoni and dry salami do not have to be
refrigerated or date marked. Shelf stable salt-cured products such as prosciutto, country
cured ham, or Parma ham do not require refrigeration or Food Code date marking. Other
salt-cured products include basturma, breasaola, coppa, and capocolla.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
454
 





Some ready-to-eat fermented sausages and salt-cured products must be refrigerated
and therefore bear the USDA-required label “Keep Refrigerated.” Examples of these
products are cooked bologna, cooked salami, and sliced country ham which are readyto-eat fermented products that need refrigeration. Bologna is a cooked, perishable
sausage and there are other salamis, e.g., cotto that are perishable.
The intact casing on shelf-stable sausages may be overwrapped to protect the cut face
of the sausage. With shelf stable (non-time/temperature control for safety food)
sausages, the intact casing provides a barrier to contamination (although not an
absolute one), the exposed face is likely to be sliced again within 4 or 7 days, and
contamination is minimized because only the face is exposed. The coagulated protein
that occurs on the surface of some nonshelf stable cooked sausages is not a casing.
Slices of cured and fermented sausages that require refrigeration and are kept for
24 hours or longer do need to be date marked.
If open dating information is applied to lunchmeats at a federally inspected meat or
poultry establishment, the information must comply with the requirements in 9 CFR
317.8 and 381.129. However, such dating is not required by USDA/FSIS and if applied,
would not supercede or replace date marking requirements established by the Food
Code or by State/local authorities that apply after the food is opened in a retail
establishment.
Manufacturer’s use-by dates
It is not the intent of this provision to give a product an extended shelf life beyond that
intended by the manufacturer. Manufacturers assign a date to products for various
reasons, and spoilage may or may not occur before pathogen growth renders the
product unsafe. Most, but not all, sell-by or use-by dates are voluntarily placed on food
packages.
Although most use-by and sell-by dates are not enforceable by regulators, the
manufacturer's use-by date is its recommendation for using the product while its quality
is at its best. Although it is a guide for quality, it could be based on food safety reasons.
It is recommended that food establishments consider the manufacturer’s information as
good guidance to follow to maintain the quality (taste, smell, and appearance) and
salability of the product. If the product becomes inferior quality-wise due to time in
storage, it is possible that safety concerns are not far behind.
It is not the intention of this provision that either the manufacturer’s date or the date
marked by the food establishment be placed on consumer packages.

3-501.19 Using Time as a Public Health Control.
The 2000 Conference for Food Protection (CFP) meeting recommended that FDA ask
the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) to
review the Food Code provision that addresses using time alone as a public health
control, section 3-501.19. In response to the CFP recommendation, FDA in
consultation with USDA/FSIS, determined that there is sufficient scientific information
available to support the current provision in the Food Code without requesting
consideration by the NACMCF. As an alternative response, FDA informed the CFP that
it would provide the following position paper on using time alone as a public health
control.
Position Paper
Food Code section 3-501.19 allows time/temperature control for safety food that is
ready-to-eat (RTE) to be stored without temperature control for up to 4 hours, after
which it must be discarded or consumed or for up to 6 hours for refrigerated food, if the
food is 5°C (41°F) when initially removed from temperature control, and as long as the
food temperature does not exceed 21°C (70°F). The following information is provided to
explain the reasoning in allowing time alone to be used as a public health control for
food safety.
Background Information
Food kept without temperature control allows product to warm or cool as it equilibrates
with the environment. Each temperature scenario incurs different risks in regard to the
type of foodborne pathogens able to grow and the rate of growth likely to occur. For
both cooling and warming conditions, growth depends on the amount of time the food
spends in an optimum growth temperature range during its equilibration with its
surroundings. Several factors influence the rate of temperature change in a food, such
as the type of food, thickness of the food, and temperature differential between the food
and its surroundings. When evaluating the safety of a 4-hour limit for food with no
temperature control, products and environmental parameters must be selected to
create a worst-case scenario for pathogens growth and possible toxin production.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
456
 







Holding Cold Food Without Temperature Control
When a food is removed from refrigerated storage and begins to warm to room
temperature, Listeria monocytogenes is a primary organism of concern. Even while
food is held at refrigeration temperatures, the growth potential of L. monocytogenes
warrants concern for time/temperature control for safety foods RTE foods. Although the
FDA and USDA have a zero tolerance for L. monocytogenes in RTE food, conditions
are permitted in the Food Code that would allow L. monocytogenes cells 1 log of
growth (3.3 generations). Salmonella is also a concern especially with products
containing eggs. However L. monocytogenes grows more rapidly than Salmonella at
refrigeration and room temperatures. By ensuring minimal Listeria growth in food, the
threat from Salmonella would be negligible. Warming conditions will allow food to
remain exposed to temperatures that allow B. cereus to produce emetic toxin.
However the 4-hour time constraint in the Food Code is sufficient to prevent any toxin
formation.
For food refrigerated at 41ºF or 45°F then transferred to an ambient temperature of
75°F for 4 hours, the growth rate of L. monocytogenes remains slow enough to ensure
that the critical limit of 1 log growth is not reached. Published generation times at 75°F
for L. monocytogenes in food were not found, however published values at 68ºF and
70°F in egg and milk products confirmed slow L. monocytogenes growth at room
temperatures.
Using the USDA Pathogen Modeling Program (PMP) and assuming the optimum
conditions of pH 6.8, 0.5% NaCl, 0.0% nitrite, L. monocytogenes would require more
than 4 hours to grow 1 log at 75°F. The PMP is based on broth studies and not on food
products. Therefore, the growth rates reported at various temperatures by the PMP are
faster than growth rates in most food products. Another factor exaggerating the growth
rate in this warming scenario as predicted by the PMP is the assumption that the food
product spent all 4 hours at 75°F. Obviously food equilibrates with the surrounding
environment at a gradual rate and would not equilibrate instantly.
Unfortunately there are no models that take changing temperatures into consideration
when predicting growth. Likewise there are very few published papers dealing with the
growth of organisms in food during warming. The conservative nature of the 4-hour
limit for keeping foods without temperature control allows for a needed margin of safety
if the temperature of the environment is higher than 75°F.
It is important to note that time/temperature control for safety foods held without cold
holding temperature control for a period of 4 hours do not have any temperature control
or monitoring. These foods can reach any temperature when held at ambient air
temperatures as long as they are discarded or consumed within the four hours.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
457
 



Holding Hot Food without Temperature Control
The second scenario for food without temperature control exists when food is cooked
according to Food Code recommendations, then kept at room temperature for 4 hours
before discarding. Foodborne pathogens of concern for an uncontrolled temperature
scenario are sporeformers including Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus.
Food cooked according to Food Code guidelines should be free of vegetative cells.
However, the heat requirements are not sufficient to kill spores of C. perfringens or
B. cereus and may actually serve as a heat shock that activates the spores. B. cereus
is found commonly in outbreaks attributed to inadequate hot holding of starchy foods
like rice, and has been isolated in a multitude of food products. C. perfringens is found
commonly in outbreaks attributed to inadequate hot holding of beef and poultry.
Despite the prevalence of both spores in nature, C. perfringens cases are estimated to
be more numerous than B. cereus cases by a factor of 10.
B. cereus can produce emetic toxin in food, and the optimum temperature for the
production of toxin is between 77°F and 86°F. However, the time needed to produce
the toxin is longer than the time the food will be exposed to any temperature range with
a 4-hour holding limit. Both C. perfringens and B. cereus produce enterotoxin inside
the intestine of the infected host if substantial numbers of vegetative cells are present in
the food (105-7 CFU/g). Although the reported levels of both spores in raw foods vary in
the literature, generally the level expected in food can be assumed to be low (around
10-1000 CFU/g). This implies that conditions allowing 1 log growth of either spore
could be tolerated in food.
During the time without temperature control, the temperature of the food could
decrease slowly enough to expose spores of both organisms to optimal growth
conditions for a significant length of time. Like warming, several variables exist that
determine the rate of heat transfer. Because of the wide variety of foods prepared it
would be impossible to generalize how fast a typical product loses temperature after
cooking. As with warming, it is prudent to imagine a worst-case scenario where heat
loss is slowed. A beef roast slow cooked to 130°F for the appropriate time according to
the Food Code was used as consideration for possible spore growth. Cooking roast
beef to 130°F can create an anaerobic environment in both the meat and gravy. The
low internal temperature creates a small temperature differential with the environment
(assumed at 75°F), allowing for a slower decrease in the food’s temperature.
After evaluating published studies as well as data collected at the FDA, the surface of a
roast beef or rolled meat product would lose heat quickly enough to discourage
significant growth of either C. perfringens or B. cereus. If all spores were distributed
on the surface of the product by either pre- or post-cooking contamination, storing this
product for 4 hours at room conditions would be considered safe. Likewise, products
that are stirred or products that lose heat faster than a roast would also be considered
safe.

At the 2004 meeting of the CFP, a committee submitted and the Conference accepted
a document that examined scientific research related to the growth of Listeria
monocytogenes, and the influence of time and temperature on its growth.
The 2004 CFP report stated that the USDA-PMP program can be used as a tool to
estimate time periods for a 1-log increase in growth for Listeria monocytogenes in
ideal (laboratory media) growth conditions. Using this modeling approach, at 41°F,
45°F, and 50°F, the time for a 1-log increase was, 87.8, 53.9, and 34.7 hours,
respectively. At room temperature (70°F) a 1-log increase was noted at 5.2 hours and
at ideal growth temperatures (95°F), the reported time for a 1-log increase was 3.0
hours. In general, the data from the USDA-PMP program provides very conservative
growth data and, in most cases, growth would be expected to be less rapid in a food
system. This table does provide comparative information relative to growth rates at
different holding temperatures in the event that time was used as a factor in managing
food safely.
The report further recommended that food could safely be held for up to 6 hours without
external temperature control as long as the food temperature did not exceed 70°F.
Based on that report and data from the Quantitative Assessment of the Relative Risk to
Public Health from Foodborne Listeria monocytogenes Among Selected Categories of
Ready-to-Eat Foods September 2003, the Food Code allows time/temperature control
for safety food to be stored up to 6 hours without external temperature control provided
that the food temperature does not exceed 70°F and the food is discarded or consumed
at the end of the 6 hours.
The Safety of the Time as a Public Health Control Provision from Cooking
Temperatures (135°F or above) to Ambient
FDA conducted in-house laboratory experiments to test the safety of the existing TPHC
provisions of 4 hours without temperature control starting with an initial temperature of
135°F or above. Clostridium perfringens was chosen to represent a worst case scenario
pathogen for foods allowed to cool from cooking temperatures to ambient without
temperature control, because its spores can survive normal cooking procedures, it can
grow at relatively high temperatures (>120°F) and it has a short lag period.
C. perfringens spores were inoculated into foods that were cooked and then cooled to
yield a cooling curve that would promote outgrowth as quickly as possible. The growth
data suggest that the existing 4-hour TPHC provision will be safe for 6 hours after
cooking, with the additional 2-hour margin of safety built-in for consumer handling.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
459
 

Consumer Handling Practices
An Audits International study was funded in 1999 by FDA to determine the food
handling practices of consumers purchasing food at retail and returning home to
refrigerate their items. Forty-six (46) states are represented, and the data comprises
several food groups purchased from different grocery-store types. The food groups
represented were: pre-packaged lunch meat, deli-counter products, seafood, fresh
meat, pre-packaged deli product, liquid dairy, semi-solid dairy product, ice cream,
frozen entrées, frozen novelties and whipped topping.
The study evaluated information regarding time and food temperature at retail food
stores, time to reach home refrigeration, temperature after transport home, location and
type of retail establishment where purchase was made and type of product purchased.
For product temperature at retail and after transportation, 5 product categories were
used: pre packaged lunch meat, pre packaged deli product, deli counter products,
seafood and fresh meat. These categories were considered most applicable to the
TPHC recommendations. The temperature ranges for these products at retail and after
transport to the home are summarized in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The data
suggest that with current retail refrigeration practices, 25% of items are held above 45°F
(Figure 1). The data also show that by the time the product arrives at the home, 98% of
products were at 65°F or less (Figure 2).
The time of transport for all food categories from the retail establishment to home
refrigeration was also recorded. The data summarized in Figure 3 shows that over 97%
of the foods purchased were ready to be placed in refrigeration within 2 hours of
purchase. For this histogram, all food categories except for frozen entrées were
included. Because all foods end up bagged and transported together, the time each
product was transported to the home was considered a valid data point and therefore
used. Based on the data, a benchmark was established that TCS foods purchased in a
food establishment would be either consumed, or placed under temperature control,
within 2 hours.

The Safety of the Time as a Public Health Control Provision from Refrigeration
Temperatures (41°F or less) to Ambient
As noted above, the current TPHC provision has two time provisions. Food can be kept
with no temperature stipulations for 4 hours in a food establishment, at which time the
food must be cooked and served, served if RTE, or discarded within the four hours.
However, if food does not exceed 70°F, it may be held for 6 hours and cooked and
served, served if RTE or discarded within the six hours. For foods warming from
refrigeration to ambient temperatures, the data from the Audits International study
outlined above, along with simulations from the USDA Pathogen Modeling Program
(PMP), were used to determine the safety of the existing TPHC recommendations.
Assuming pathogen growth in foods going from refrigeration (41°F or less) to ambient
temperature, the following parameters were used for the PMP simulation:
•	 65°F was used as the temperature for the entire simulation;
•	 2 hours were added to all times (4h or 6h) allowed in the current TPHC
recommendation, to factor in transportation time (per the Audits International
study outlined above);
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
463
 
•	 The data were generated from PMP broth models (pH 6.8), with the minimal
NaCl and no sodium nitrite.
Table 1 summarizes the predicted growth of Bacillus cereus (vegetative), Escherichia
coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Shigella flexneri, and Staphylococcus
aureus, using the PMP and based on the assumptions discussed above. The data
predicted that less than 1-log growth would be seen for each organism, during the
8 hour time period. Thus, the data show that the current 4 and 6 hour TPHC provisions
from 41°F or less to ambient, allow minimal growth of a number of pathogens of
concern.

Raw eggs
Recipes in which more than one egg is combined carry an increased risk of illness and
possible serious consequences for certain people. It is due to this increased risk, and
documented occurrences of foodborne illness and death among highly susceptible
populations from temperature-abused raw shell eggs contaminated with Salmonella
Enteritidis, that the use of time as a public health control in institutional settings is not
allowed.

Specialized
Processing
Methods
3-502.11 Variance Requirement.
Specific food processes that require a variance have historically resulted in more
foodborne illness than standard processes. They present a significant health risk if not
conducted under strict operational procedures. These types of operations may require
the person in charge and food employees to use specialized equipment and
demonstrate specific competencies. The variance requirement is designed to ensure
that the proposed method of operation is carried out safely.
The concept of variances may be new to some regulatory authorities. Some
jurisdictions may not have a formal process to respond to industry requests for
variances, although informal allowances may have been allowed in specific situations.
Recognizing the opportunity to use the variance process may require additional
rulemaking, or at least policy development, at the jurisdictional level. Rulemaking can
be used to outline the procedures for a variance request, including the information
required in section 8-103.11. In addition, the rulemaking process can address the
regulatory authority’s responsibility to consider an industry’s variance application and an
appeals process in case a variance is not given due consideration or is denied. The
Conference for Food Protection Variance Committee recommended that regulatory
agencies adopt a variance review process. General guidance regarding administrative
procedures is given below.
Regulatory authorities considering implementing variances have encountered issues
relating to their authority or technical, scientific ability to evaluate or validate a variance
request. From any variance request there may emerge a set of complex issues and
scientific competencies beyond the ability of the regulatory authority to validate. The
Conference for Food Protection Variance Committee recommended that rulemaking
should reflect a multi-level matrix of regulatory agencies ranging from local regulatory
authorities through FDA and reflected that recommendation in the following flow chart.
The regulatory authority is encouraged to seek input and guidance from authoritative
sources such as processing authorities, professional associations, or academia. Within
the Variance Committee's model, the process for seeking FDA advice begins with the
Regional Food Specialists.
Except for the Interstate Travel Program, FDA generally does not directly regulate retail
and food service establishments, including entertaining variances for that segment of
the industry. FDA is still exploring processes for handling variances on a national basis
such as those received from national chain businesses. In conjunction with the 2000
CFP Variance Committee, FDA will continue to explore ways to provide assistance and
guidance to regulators regarding access to scientific and technical resources in order to
make science-based decisions regarding variances.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
465
 
FDA recommends that regulatory authorities develop a written administrative process
that is consistent with, and addresses the information contained in, Food Code sections
8-103.10, 8-103.11, and 8-103.12, and follow a process consistent with the
recommendations of the CFP Variance Committee as shown in its flow chart.

3-502.11 Chart 1 – A Model Flow Process for State Regulators to Address Variances
Developed by the CFP Variance Committee
Model Administrative Procedures for Regulators to Address Variances
1) Designate an agency team and assign a leader to address variance requests.
2) Establish an agency review process leading to approval or denial of variance
applications. For food safety issues, include recommendations for consulting with
food processing authorities, food scientists, academia, professional organizations,
other government agencies including the FDA Regional Food Specialist, or other
experts external to the agency.
3) Set reasonable timelines for decision making. Determine if the variance application
addresses an intrastate or interstate issue.
a) For variances that have interstate or national implications, especially those that
address food safety, regulators are urged to contact and work closely with their
FDA Regional Food Specialist to determine if a national policy related to the
issue exists. Regulators are encouraged to be consistent with national policies,
guidelines, or opinions.
b) For variances that address intrastate issues, regulators are also encouraged to
determine if other State or national guidance exists, and to stay consistent with it.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
467
 






4) Make the agency’s decision. Inform the applicant.
a) If the variance request is approved, determine the starting date and document all
special provisions with which the applicant must comply.
b) If the variance request is denied, inform the applicant as to the reasons for the
denial, the applicant's right to appeal, and the appeal process.
5) Inform other interested parties, including the FDA Regional Food Specialist.
a) For variances having interstate or national implications, especially those that
address food safety, regulators are urged to inform their FDA Regional Food
Specialist so that FDA is aware of, and can appropriately disseminate the
information regarding food safety variances that may affect food establishments
in other jurisdictions, such as national chains.
b) For variances that address intrastate issues, regulators are encouraged to share
the information as if it were an interstate issue.
6) Document all agency actions and decisions in the facility’s file. Consider including
documentation of special variance provisions on the establishment's permit to
operate.
7) If the variance is approved, inform the inspector assigned to that facility and train the
inspector on the variance provisions, including the implementation of the industry’s
HACCP plan, if required.
8) Establish procedures to periodically review the status of the variance, determine if it
successfully accomplishes its public health objective, and ensure that a health
hazard or nuisance does not result from its implementation.
9) Establish written procedures for withdrawing approval of the variance if it is not
successful.

3-502.12	 Reduced Oxygen Packaging Without a
Variance, Criteria.
Reduced oxygen packaging (ROP) encompasses a large variety of packaging methods
where the internal environment of the package contains less than the normal ambient
oxygen level (typically 21% at sea level), including vacuum packaging (VP), modified
atmosphere packaging (MAP), controlled atmosphere packaging (CAP), cook chill
processing (CC), and sous vide (SV). Using ROP methods in food establishments has
the advantage of providing extended shelf life to many foods because it inhibits
spoilage organisms that are typically aerobic. ROP may also offer benefits related to
time and labor savings, portion control and quality retention. However, ROP can also
increase the potential for the growth of certain pathogens in the absence of the growth
of competing spoilage organisms. For example, if certain controls are not in place, the
formation of C. botulinum toxin may occur before spoilage renders the product
unacceptable to the consumer.
The type of food, the production and packaging methods used, and the packaging
material can impact the level of oxygen present within a package and within the food
matrix. Combinations of some or all of these variables may result in an oxygen level
within a package, or within a food matrix, that is less than 21%. While ROP may
involve different foods and different packaging materials, each process is characterized
by the deliberate removal of oxygen from or the reduction in the oxygen level in the
package or the food matrix at the time of packaging.
Certain foodborne pathogens that are anaerobes or facultative anaerobes are able to
multiply under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Therefore special controls are
necessary to control their growth. Refrigerated storage temperatures of 5°C (41°F) may
be adequate to prevent growth and/or toxin production of some pathogenic
microorganisms but non-proteolytic C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes are able to
multiply well below 5°C (41°F). For this reason, C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes
are the pathogens of concern for ROP. Controlling their growth will control the growth
of other foodborne pathogens as well.
Reduced Oxygen Packaging with Two Barriers
When followed as written, the ROP methods in this section all provide controls for the
growth and/or toxin production of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes without a
variance. Paragraph 3-502.12 (B) identifies an ROP method with secondary barriers
that will control C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes when used in conjunction with a
food storage temperature of 5°C (41°F) or less. These barriers are:
•	 aw of 0.91 or less;
•	 pH of 4.6 or less;
•	 cured, USDA inspected meat or poultry products using substances specified in 9
CFR 424.21; or
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
469
 










•	 high levels of competing microorganisms such as those found on raw meat or
raw poultry or raw vegetables.
The barriers described above are effective controls for C. botulinum and L.
monocytogenes in reduced oxygen packaged foods because:
•	 C. botulinum will not produce toxin below an aw of 0.91, and the minimum aw for
growth of L. monocytogenes is 0.92.
•	 C. botulinum will not produce toxin when the pH is 4.6 or below and L.

monocytogenes will generally not grow at this pH under refrigeration
temperatures.

•	 Nitrite, used in meat and poultry curing, inhibits the outgrowth of C. botulinum
spores.
•	 Most foodborne pathogens do not compete well with other microorganisms.
Therefore foods that have a high level of spoilage organisms or lactic acid
bacteria that grow under ROP conditions can safely be packaged using ROP and
held for up to 30 days at 5°C (41°F).
Other intrinsic or extrinsic factors can also control the growth and/or toxin production of
C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
Foods that are not time/temperature control for safety food (TCS) should not support
the growth of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes. Therefore the reduced oxygen
packaging HACCP requirements of sections 3-502.11 or 3-502.12, apply only to TCS
foods.
Reduced Oxygen Packaging with One Barrier (Cook-Chill and Sous Vide)
Some foods may not have secondary barriers to prevent the growth of C. botulinum
and L. monocytogenes, such as aw, pH, nitrite in cured meat products, high levels of
competing microorganisms or intrinsic factors in certain cheeses. When these foods
are packaged using a reduced oxygen packaging process, time/temperature becomes
the critical controlling factor for growth of C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes. Nonproteolytic C. botulinum spores are able to germinate and produce toxin at
temperatures down to 3ºC (38ºF). Therefore, holding ROP foods at 3ºC (38ºF) or less
should prevent the formation of C. botulinum toxin. L. monocytogenes is able to
grow, although very slowly, at temperatures down to - 1ºC (30ºF). The lag phase and
generation time of both pathogens becomes shorter as the storage temperature
increases. In ¶ 3-502.12(D), cook-chill processing where food is cooked then sealed in
a barrier bag while still hot and sous vide processing where food is sealed in a barrier
bag and then cooked, both depend on time/temperature alone as the only barrier to
pathogenic growth. Therefore, monitoring critical limits including those established for
cooking to destroy vegetative cells, cooling to prevent outgrowth of spores/toxin
production, and maintaining cold storage temperatures to inhibit growth and/or toxin
production of any surviving pathogens is essential. Three separate options are
provided in (D)(2)(e).
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
470
 




These time-temperature combinations will provide equivalent food safety protection
without need for a variance. (L. monocytogenes will be eliminated by the cooking
procedures specified in ¶¶3-401.11(A), (B) and (C) and recontamination will be
prevented by filling the product into the bag while it is still hot (cook-chill) or by cooking
in the sealed bag (sous vide). C. botulinum will not grow under the specified timetemperature combinations.)
Since there may not be other controlling factors for C. botulinum and L.
monocytogenes in a cook-chill or sous vide packaged product, continuous monitoring
of temperature control and visual examination to verify refrigeration temperatures is
important. New technology makes it possible to continuously and electronically
monitor temperatures of refrigeration equipment used to hold cook-chill and sous vide
products at 1°C (34°F) or 5°C (41°F) or less. Thermocouple data loggers can connect
directly with commonly available thermocouple probes. Recording charts are also
commonly used. Temperature monitors and alarm systems will activate an alarm or
dialer if temperatures rise above preset limits. Nickel-sized data loggers are available
to record temperatures that can be displayed using computer software. Since surveys
have shown that temperature control in home kitchens is not always adequate, food
packaged using cook-chill or sous vide processing methods cannot be distributed
outside the control of the food establishment doing the packaging.
Reduced Oxygen Packaging with Cheese
Cheeses, as identified in ¶ 3-502.12(E), that meet the Standards of Identity for hard,
pasteurized process, and semisoft cheeses in 21 CFR 133.150, 21 CFR 133.169, or 21
CFR 133.187, respectively, contain various intrinsic factors, often acting synergistically,
that together act as a secondary barrier to pathogen growth along with refrigerated
storage at 5°C (41°F) or less. This combination of factors could include some or all of
the following:
• a lower pH;
• salt (NaCl) added during processing;
• low moisture content;
• added preservatives; and
• live competing cultures.
The extended shelf life for vacuum packaged hard and semisoft cheeses is based on
the intrinsic factors in these cheeses plus the refrigeration temperature of 41°F or less
to maintain safety. Examples of cheeses that may be packaged under ROP include
Asiago medium, Asiago old, Cheddar, Colby, Emmentaler, Gruyere, Parmesan,
Reggiano, Romano, Sapsago, Swiss, pasteurized process cheese, Asiago fresh and
soft, Blue, Brick, Edam, Gorgonzola, Gouda, Limburger, Monterey, Monterey Jack,
Muenster, Provolone, and Roquefort. Soft cheeses such as Brie, Camembert, Cottage,
and Ricotta may not be packaged under reduced oxygen because of their ability to
support the growth of L. monocytogenes under modified atmosphere conditions.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
471
 




Reduced Oxygen Packaging with Fish
Unfrozen raw fish and other seafood are specifically excluded from ROP at retail
because of these products’ natural association with non-proteolytic C. botulinum
(primarily type E) which grows at 3o
C (37-38o
F). ROP of fish and seafood that are
frozen before, during and after the ROP packaging process does not present this
hazard.
HACCP Plans with Reduced Oxygen Packaging
A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan is essential when using
ROP processing procedures. C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes are potential
hazards which must be controlled in most TCS foods. Critical control points, critical
limits, monitoring, record keeping, corrective actions, and verification procedures will
vary based on the type of food and type of ROP technology used. Developing a
HACCP plan and providing a copy to the regulatory authority prior to implementation
provides notice to the regulatory authority that the food establishment intends to
conduct ROP operations and makes it possible to verify that the appropriate ROP
procedures are being followed and that the requirements of §3-502.12 are being met.
When a food establishment intends to conduct ROP and hold the product for more than
48 hours without using one of the secondary barriers defined in section 3-502.12 (the
criteria specified in paragraph 3-502.12(D) combined with holding the product at 5°C
(41°F) or less, or hard or semisoft cheeses manufactured using Standards of Identity
for those cheeses), it is important that an application for a variance (under section 3­
502.11) provide evidence that the ROP methodology intended for use is safe.
The Relationship Between Time and Reduced Oxygen Packaging
Time is also a factor that must be considered in ROP at retail. The use of date labels
on VP, MAP, and CAP products and assuring those dates do not exceed the
manufacturer’s “sell by” or “use by” date is intended to limit the shelf life to a safe time
period (based on a time in which growth will not occur or involves the presence of two
barriers to growth). When these ROP products are frozen, there is no longer a
restricted shelf life. The shelf life limits for cook-chill and sous-vide foods are based on
killing all vegetative cells in the cooking process, preventing recontamination, and then
refrigerating at 1°C (34°F) or less for 30 days or 5°C (41°F) or less for 7 days after
packaging, with stringent temperature monitoring and recording requirements. These
criteria allow both institutional-sized cook-chill operations that may feed thousands
daily, often including transportation to their satellite locations, and individual restaurants
without ice banks and tumble or blast chillers to safely use cook-chill and sous-vide
processes.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
472
 











3-502.12 (F) exempts refrigerated, ROP foods that are always removed from the
package within 48 hours of packaging from the requirements in section 3-502.12
because growth and toxin formation by anaerobic pathogens in that limited time frame
is not considered a significant hazard in such foods.
Accurate
Representation
3-601.11 Standards of Identity.
3-601.12 Honestly Presented.
Labeling 3-602.11 Food Labels.
3-602.12 Other Forms of Information.
The identity of a food in terms of origin and composition is important for instances when
a food may be implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak and for nutritional information
requirements. Ingredient information is needed by consumers who have allergies to
certain food or ingredients. The appearance of a food should not be altered or
disguised because it is a cue to the consumer of the food's identity and condition.
Food Labels and other forms of Information
Food labels serve as a primary means by which consumers can make informed
decisions about their food selections. Many items in a food establishment are provided
by the food employee to the consumer upon consumer request. When a consumer
orders a specific food or specific amount of food from a food employee, that employee
may put the food in a wrapper or carry-out container at the time the order is placed.
This food is not considered “packaged”, per the Food Code definition; it was merely
wrapped or placed in a carry-out container to facilitate service and delivery of the food
to the consumer in a protected manner. When food is under the direct control of the
operator and provided to the consumer upon consumer request, the consumer has an
opportunity to ask about ingredients, nutrients, allergens and weight.
Alternatively, some food items are enclosed in a container or wrapping for use in the
display of that item for consumer self-service. In these instances, the label provides an
important source of information for consumers to answer questions about ingredients,
allergens, weight, and manufacturer.
List of Ingredients
A list of ingredients on the label enables a consumer to make an informed decision
about a packaged food product. Therefore it is important that the list of ingredients
accurately describe all of the ingredients present in the food. In some instances, an
ingredient itself may be composed of two or more ingredients, or sub-ingredients. The
21 CFR 101.4(b)(2), calls for the sub-ingredients to be declared on the label - d. One
example includes parenthetically listing the individual sub-ingredients in descending
order of predominance after the common or usual name of the main ingredient, as
illustrated here:
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
473
 









•	 Bread pudding: bread (wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, honey), milk,
eggs, and sugar
Another example is to incorporate the common or usual name of each sub ingredient
into the list of ingredients in descending order of predominance in the finished food
without listing the ingredient itself, as illustrated here :
•	 Bread pudding: milk, wheat flour, water, eggs, sugar, yeast, salt, and
honey.
Food Allergen Labeling
The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (Public Law 108­
282) require that all affected packages of food labeled on or after January 1, 2006
identify on the label the names of the food sources of any major food allergens (i.e., the
following eight foods and any protein derived from them: milk, egg, fish, Crustacean
shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans) used as ingredients in the food.
Providing the name of the food source on the label of packaged foods alerts consumers
to the presence of a major food allergen and may prevent an inadvertent exposure.
The names of the food sources are the same as the names of the eight foods that are
major food allergens, with the exception that for fish, crustacean shellfish, and tree
nuts, their respective food source names are the specific species of fish (e.g., bass,
flounder, or cod), the specific species of crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or
shrimp), and the specific types of tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts).
Nutrition Labeling
Certain requirements in the CFR relating to aspects of nutrition labeling became
effective in May, 1997. The following attempts to provide guidance regarding those
requirements and exemptions as they relate to the retail environment and to alert
regulators to authority that has been given to them by the Nutrition Labeling and
Education Act (NLEA) of 1990. The statute and the CFR should be reviewed to ensure
a comprehensive understanding of the labeling requirements.
I. The following foods need not comply with nutrition labeling in the CFR referenced
in subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(6) if they do not bear a nutrient claim, health claim, or
other nutrition information:
(A) Foods packaged in a food establishment if:
(1) The food establishment has total annual sales to consumers of no
more than $500,000 (or no more than $50,000 in food sales alone), and
(2) The label of the food does not bear a reference to the manufacturer
or processor other than the food establishment;
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
474
 






(B) Low-volume food products if:
(1) The annual sales are less than 100,000 units for which a notification
claiming exemption has been filed with FDA's Office of Nutritional
Products Labeling and Dietary Supplements Food Labeling by a small
business with less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, or
(2) The annual sales are less than 10,000 units by a small business with
less than 10 full-time equivalent employees;
(C) Foods served in food establishments with facilities for immediate
consumption such as restaurants, cafeterias, and mobile food establishments,
and foods sold only in those establishments;
(D) Foods similar to those specified in the preceding bullet but that are sold by
food establishments without facilities for immediate consumption such as
bakeries and grocery stores if the food is:
(1) Ready-to-eat but not necessarily for immediate consumption,
(2) Prepared primarily in the food establishment from which it is sold, and
(3) Not offered for sale outside the food establishment;
(E) Foods of no nutritional significance such as coffee;
(F) Bulk food for further manufacturing or repacking; and
(G) Raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.
II. Game animal meats shall provide nutrition information which may be provided by
labeling displayed at the point of purchase such as on a counter card, sign, tag
affixed to the food, or some other appropriate device.
III. Food packaged in a food processing plant or another food establishment, shall
meet the requirements specified in § 3-602.11 and enforcement by the regulatory
authority is authorized in the NLEA, Section 4. State Enforcement.
Canthaxanthin and Astaxanthin
Canthaxanthin and Astaxanthin are color additives for salmonid fish. According to the
FDA Regulatory Fish Encyclopedia, the family Salmonidae includes pink salmon, coho
salmon, sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, Atlantic salmon, chum salmon, rainbow
trout, cutthroat trout, and brown trout. These color additives may be in the feed that is
fed to aquacultured fish. When those fish are placed into a bulk container for shipment,
the bulk container will bear a label declaring the presence of canthaxanthin.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
475
 








Providing this information on the label of fish packaged and offered for sale at retail will
inform the consumer of the presence of these additives
21 CFR 73.75 promulgates requirements for the use of canthaxanthin in salmonid fish.
21 CFR 73.35 promulgates requirements for the use of astaxanthin in salmonid fish.
For additional information, see the Federal Register announcement 63 FR 14814,

Safe Handling Instructions
Refer to public health reason for § 3-201.11 Labeling for Meat and Poultry.
Consumer
Advisory
3-603.11 Consumption of Raw or Undercooked Animal
Foods.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-401.11.
Purpose:
At issue is the role of government agencies, the regulated industry, and others in
providing notice to consumers that animal-derived foods that are not subjected to
adequate heat treatment pose a risk because they may contain biological agents that
cause foodborne disease. The deliverance of a balanced message that communicates
fairly to all consumers and, where epidemiologically supported, attempts to place risk in
perspective based on the consumer's health status and the food being consumed is
part of the challenge. Notification of risk must be achieved via a meaningful message
and in a manner that is likely to affect behavior. The following information is to alert the
reader to the options available to food establishments in advising consumers of the
increased possibility of foodborne illness when animal-derived foods are eaten raw or
undercooked.
Background:
Although no specific advisory language was recommended, beginning with the 1993
Food Code, FDA included a codified provision for a point-of-purchase consumer
advisory and stated in Annex 3:
"FDA has requested comments and will consider the responses as well as other
information that is available related to the risks involved and methods of risk
communication to determine what action may be necessary by FDA to effectively
inform consumers."
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
476
 















Consumer Focus Groups:
During 1996 - 1998, FDA conducted two different consumer focus group studies.
Because the first set of focus groups (conducted before the 1997 Code) were not
receptive to the language recommended at the 1996 Conference for Food Protection
(CFP) meeting, that language was not included in the 1997 Code. Before the 1998
CFP meeting, the Agency convened a second set of focus groups with a modified
approach. The latter set expressed similar thoughts as those in the earlier set and a
pattern for consumer acceptance and receptiveness to menu-based advisories
emerged.
It became apparent that there is a general appreciation for "disclosure" of what
consumers view as "hidden ingredients, " for example, whether a particular menu item
contains raw egg. In addition to disclosure being viewed as helpful, consumers are
accepting, if not appreciative, of a "reminder" that consuming raw or undercooked
animal-derived foods carries an increased risk of foodborne illness. In the food
establishment venue, consumers are less willing to accept a message that extends
beyond a reminder and becomes a lesson or an educational message.
Satisfactory Compliance:
FDA submitted to the 1998 CFP meeting an Issue that asked the Conference to discuss
an approach that incorporated the knowledge obtained from the consumer testing. It
was the consensus of the CFP that satisfactory compliance with the Code’s
consumer advisory provision is fulfilled when both a disclosure and reminder are
provided, as described in § 3-603.11 of the Code. Disclosure is achieved when there
is clear identification of animal-derived foods that are sold or served raw or
undercooked, and of items that either contain or may contain (to allow for ingredient
substitution) such raw or undercooked ingredients. A third option for the consumer
“reminder” was added later. The reminder is a notice about the relationship between
thorough cooking and food safety.
Two options were endorsed for disclosure and two for the reminder. One of the
reminder options is a menu statement that advises consumers that food safety
information about the disclosed items is available upon request. Essential criteria for
such written information are available from FDA through the Retail Food Protection
Team by writing to: FDA/CFSAN, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, (HFS-320) College Park,
Maryland 20740. All brochures must meet these essential criteria. The other option is
a short notice alerting consumers to the increased risk of consuming the disclosed
menu items.
In response to concerns raised by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC)
in an October 8, 1998 letter to FDA, a third option has been added to allow for a
statement that links an increased risk of illness to consumption of raw or undercooked
animal foods by persons with certain medical conditions.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
477
 






The information contained in both the disclosure and reminder should be publicly
available and readable so that consumers have benefit of the total message (disclosure
and reminder) before making their order selections.
It is not possible to anticipate all conceivable situations. Therefore, there will always be
need for discussion between the food establishment and the Regulatory Authority as to
the most effective way to meet the objectives of satisfactory compliance.
The Implementation Guidance for the Consumer Advisory Provision of the FDA Food
Code (section 3-603.11 in the FDA Model Food Code), is a resource intended to assist
regulators and industry in the implementation of the Consumer Advisory provision. It is
recommended that it be used in conjunction with the FDA Food Code. It is available
from FDA through the Retail Food Protection Team by writing to: FDA/CFSAN, 5100
Paint Branch Parkway, (HFS-320) College Park, Maryland 20740.
Locating the Advisory:
Disclosure of raw or undercooked animal-derived foods or ingredients and reminders
about the risk of consuming such foods belong at the point where the food is selected
by the consumer. Both the disclosure and the reminder need to accompany the
information from which the consumer makes a selection. That information could appear
in many forms such as a menu, a placarded listing of available choices, or a table tent.
Educational Messages:
Educational messages are usually longer, more didactic in nature, and targeted to
consumers who have been alerted to the food safety concern and take the initiative to
obtain more detailed information. It is expected that, in most cases, educational
messages that are provided pursuant to § 3-603.11 (i.e., in situations where the option
for referring the consumer to additional information is chosen), will be embodied in
brochures that will not be read at the site where the immediate food choice is being
made. Nonetheless, such messages are viewed as an important facet of arming
consumers with the information needed to make informed decisions and, because the
information is being requested by the consumer, it would be expected to play a role in
subsequent choices.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
478
 








Applicability:
Food Establishments:
The consumer advisory is intended to apply to all food establishments where raw or
undercooked animal foods or ingredients are sold or served for human consumption in
a raw or undercooked form. This includes all types of food establishments whenever
there is a reasonable likelihood that the food will be consumed without subsequent,
thorough cooking - such as restaurants, raw bars, quick-service operations, carry-outs,
and sites where groceries are obtained that have operations such as delicatessens or
seafood departments.
"... Otherwise Processed to Eliminate Pathogens... ":
This phrase is included in § 3-603.11 to encompass new technologies and pathogen
control/reduction regimens as they are developed and validated as fulfilling a specific
performance standard for pathogens of concern. Pasteurization of milk is an example
of a long-standing validated process. For purposes of the Food Code, the level of
pathogen reduction that is required before a raw or undercooked animal food is allowed
to be offered without a consumer advisory must be equivalent to the levels provided by
§ 3-401.11 for the type of food being prepared.
The absorbed dose levels of radiation approved by FDA on December 3, 1997 for red
meat are insufficient to reduce the level of most vegetative pathogens to a point that is
equivalent to the reductions achieved in ¶¶ 3-401.11(A) and (B). Irradiated poultry
provides a 3D kill which does not provide the level of protection of the 7D kill that results
from the cooking regimen in the Food Code. Therefore, irradiated meat and poultry are
not allowed to be offered in a ready-to-eat form without a consumer advisory. It is
intended that future Food Code revisions will address time/temperature requirements
that take into consideration the pathogen reduction that occurs with irradiated foods.
Recognition of Other Processes:
Animal-derived foods may undergo validated processes that target a specific pathogen.
In such instances, along with the required consumer advisory may appear additional
language that accurately describes the process and what it achieves. For example, a
technology for reducing Vibrio vulnificus in oysters to nondetectable levels has been
validated. FDA concurs that shellfish subjected to that process can be labeled with a
truthful claim that appropriately describes the product. That is, a statement could be
made such as, "pasteurized to reduce Vibrio vulnificus" or "temperature treated to
reduce Vibrio vulnificus. " Such a claim must be in accordance with labeling laws and
regulations, accurate, and not misleading. The claim would not, however, negate the
need for a consumer advisory because the treatment only reduces the level of one
pathogenic organism.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
479
 







Product-specific Advisories:
Consumer advisories may be tailored to be product-specific if a food establishment
either has a limited menu or offers only certain animal-derived foods in a raw or
undercooked ready-to-eat form. For example, a raw bar serving molluscan shellfish on
the half shell, but no other raw or undercooked animal food, could elect to confine its
consumer advisory to shellfish. The raw bar could also choose reminder, option #3,
which would highlight the increased risk incurred when persons with certain medical
conditions ingest shellfish that has not been adequately heat treated.
Terminology:
It should be noted that the actual on-site (e.g., on-the-menu) advisory language differs
from the language in the codified provision, § 3-603.11. In the insert page for
§ 3-603.11, the Reminder options 2 and 3 use terms for foods that are less specific
than the terms used in the actual code section. That is, the words “meat” rather than
“beef, lamb, and pork” and “seafood” rather than “fish” are used. Categorical terms like
“meat” are simpler and may be more likely used in conversation, making them suitable
for purposes of a menu notice.
Milk:
In addition, “milk” is not mentioned in the actual on-site advisory language. The sale or
transportation of final packaged form of unpasteurized milk into interstate commerce is
specifically prohibited by 21 CFR 1240.61. Also the consumption of raw milk is not
recommended by FDA (this statement is in the form of an official FDA position
statement found at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati
on/Milk/ucm2007973.htm. Nonetheless, approximately 25 states allow unpasteurized
milk in intrastate commerce which usually involves direct dairy farm-to-consumer
procurement.
In the event that a food establishment governed by § 3-603.11 of this Code operates in
conjunction with a dairy farm in a State that allows the in-State sale or service of
unpasteurized milk, or in the case where a State allows unpasteurized milk to be
marketed via retail-level food establishments, consumers need to be advised of the risk
associated with drinking unpasteurized milk. In these situations, the actual advisory
language needs to be amended to include milk (refer to Consumer Advisory Reminder,
paragraph 3-603.11(C), options 2 or 3).
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
480
 













Molluscan Shellstock:
In addition to areas of retail food stores such as delis in supermarkets, the consumer
advisory is to be provided when a seafood department or seafood market offers raw
molluscan shellstock for sale or service. There is a risk of death from Vibrio infections
from consuming raw molluscan shellstock for persons who have certain medical
conditions.
Disposition 3-701.11	 Discarding or Reconditioning Unsafe,
Adulterated, or Contaminated Food.
Pathogens may be transmitted from person to person through contaminated food. The
potential spread of illness is limited when food is discarded if it may have been
contaminated by employees who are infected, or are suspected of being infected, or by
any person who otherwise contaminates it.
Additional
Safeguards
3-801.11 Pasteurized Foods, Prohibited Re-Service,
and Prohibited Food.
Refer to the public health reason for § 3-201.11.
The Code provisions that relate to highly susceptible populations are combined in this
section for ease of reference and to add emphasis to special food safety precautions
that are necessary to protect those who are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness
and for whom the implications of such illness can be dire.
As a safeguard for highly susceptible populations from the risk of contracting foodborne
illness from juice, prepackaged juice is required to be obtained pasteurized or in a
commercially sterile, shelf-stable form in a hermetically sealed container. It is important
to note that the definition of a “juice” means it is served as such or used as an
ingredient in beverages. Puréed fruits and vegetables, which are commonly prepared
as food for service to highly susceptible populations, are not juices and do not require
HACCP plans or compliance with 21 CFR Part 120. There are documented cases of
foodborne illness throughout the United States that were associated with the
consumption of various juice products contaminated with microorganisms such as
Cryptosporidium, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and
Vibrio cholera. As new information becomes available, the Food Code will be modified
or interim interpretive guidance will be issued regarding foodborne illness interventions
for on-site juicing and puréeing.
The 21 CFR 120 regulation applies to products sold as juice or used as an ingredient in
beverages. This includes fruit and vegetable purees that are used in juices and
beverages, but is not intended to include freshly prepared fruit or vegetable purees that
are prepared on-site in a facility for service to a highly susceptible population.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
481
 










In lieu of meeting the requirements of 21 CFR 120, juices that are produced as
commercially sterile products (canned juices) are acceptable for service to a highly
susceptible population. Persons providing pureed meals to highly susceptible
populations may also wish to use fruit and vegetables that are produced as
commercially sterile products (canned fruit or vegetables) as a means of enhancing
food safety.
Salmonella often survives traditional preparation techniques. It survives in a lightly
cooked omelet, French toast, stuffed pasta, and meringue pies. In 1986 there was a
large multistate outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis traced to stuffed pasta made with
raw eggs and labeled "fully cooked." Eggs remain a major source of these infections,
causing large outbreaks when they are combined and undercooked as was the case in
the 1986 outbreak linked to stuffed pasta. Therefore, special added precautions need
to be in place with those most susceptible to foodborne illness.
Operators of food establishments serving highly susceptible populations may wish to
discuss buyer specifications with their suppliers. Such specifications could stipulate
eggs that are produced only by flocks managed under a Salmonella Enteritidis control
program that is recognized by a regulatory agency that has animal health jurisdiction.
Such programs are designed to reduce the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis in raw
shell eggs. In any case, the food establishment operator must use adequate time and
temperature controls within the establishment to minimize the risk of a foodborne illness
outbreak relating to Salmonella Enteritidis.
Since 1995, raw seed sprouts have emerged as a recognized source of foodborne
illness in the United States. The FDA and CDC have issued health advisories that
persons who are at a greater risk for foodborne disease should avoid eating raw alfalfa
sprouts until such time as intervention methods are in place to improve the safety of
these products. Further information is available at the FDA website, http://www.fda.gov,
by entering “sprouts” in the search window.
Although the Code’s allowance for the Regulatory Authority to grant a variance (refer to
§§ 8-103.10 - .12, 8-201.14, and 8-304.11) is applicable to all Code provisions, variance
requests related to the preparation of food for highly susceptible populations must be
considered with particular caution and scrutiny. With all variances, the hazard(s) must
be clearly identified and controlled by a HACCP plan that is instituted in conjunction
with a standard operating plan that implements good retail practices. Variances that will
impact a highly susceptible population must be considered in light of the fact that such
a population is at a significantly higher risk of contracting foodborne illnesses and
suffering serious consequences including death from those illnesses, than is the
general population.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
482
 









Subparagraph 3-801.11(F)(3) requires a HACCP plan for the use of raw shell eggs
when eggs are combined in food establishments serving highly susceptible populations.
A variance is not required since the HACCP plan criteria are specific, prescriptive, and
conservative and require a cooking temperature and time to ensure destruction of
Salmonella Enteritidis.
3-801.11(G) and (H) Re-service of food
The Food Code addresses two issues concerning persons in isolation:
1.	 Contamination from an isolated patient to others outside.
The re-service of any food including unopened, original, intact packages in sound
condition, of non-temperature controlled for safety food from a person in isolation or
quarantine for use by anyone else (other patients, clients, or consumers) is not
permitted. The “isolation or quarantine” terminology in the Code text refers to a patientcare setting that isolates the patient, thereby preventing spread of key pathogens to
other patients and healthcare workers. Once food packages come to a contact
isolation room, they stay there until the patient uses or discards them. If packages of
food are still in the room when the patient is discharged or moved from isolation, they
must be discarded.
2. Contamination from the outside into a room with a patient in a “protective
environment” isolation setting which protects the patient from contacting pathogens
from other patients, healthcare workers, or other persons.
Packages of food from any patients, clients or other consumers should not be re-served
to persons in protective environment isolation. Precautions similar to the isolation
setting apply to this setting, i.e., once an unopened, original, intact package of
condiment is delivered to this patient, the package stays there until used or discarded.
New (not re-served) packages of food should be delivered to this patient each time.
To summarize the key difference between the two scenarios:
•	 Food packages served to patients in contact isolation may not be re-served to other
patients because of the potential for disease transmission to other patients.
•	 Patients in protective environments should not be re-served with food packages
from other patients because of the potential for disease transmission to the
protective environment patient.

Chapter 4 Equipment, Utensils, and Linens
Multiuse 4-101.11 Characteristics.
Multiuse equipment is subject to deterioration because of its nature, i.e., intended use
over an extended period of time. Certain materials allow harmful chemicals to be
transferred to the food being prepared which could lead to foodborne illness. In
addition, some materials can affect the taste of the food being prepared. Surfaces that
are unable to be routinely cleaned and sanitized because of the materials used could
harbor foodborne pathogens. Deterioration of the surfaces of equipment such as pitting
may inhibit adequate cleaning of the surfaces of equipment, so that food prepared on or
in the equipment becomes contaminated.
Inability to effectively wash, rinse and sanitize the surfaces of food equipment may lead
to the buildup of pathogenic organisms transmissible through food. Studies regarding
the rigor required to remove biofilms from smooth surfaces highlight the need for
materials of optimal quality in multiuse equipment.
4-101.12 Cast Iron, Use Limitation.
Equipment and utensils constructed of cast iron meet the requirement of durability as
intended in section 4-101.11. However, the surface characteristics of cast iron tend to
be somewhat porous which renders the material difficult to clean. On the other hand,
when cast iron use is limited to cooking surfaces the residues in the porous surface are
not of significant concern as heat destroys potential pathogens that may be present.
4-101.13 Lead, Use Limitation.
Historically, lead has been used in the formulation or decoration of these types of
utensils. Specifically, lead-based paints that were used to decorate the utensils such as
color glazes have caused high concentrations of lead to leach into the food they
contain.
Lead poisoning continues to be an important public health concern due to the
seriousness of associated medical problems. Lead poisoning is particularly harmful to
the young and has caused learning disabilities and medical problems among individuals
who have consumed high levels. The allowable levels of lead are specific to the type of
utensil, based on the average contact time and properties of the foods routinely stored
in each item listed.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
484
 










FDA has established maximum levels (see FDA Compliance Policy Guide Section
545.450 Pottery (Ceramics); Imported and Domestic – Lead Contamination (CPG
7117.07) for leachable lead in ceramicware, and pieces that exceed these levels are
subject to recall or other agency enforcement action. The levels are based on how
frequently a piece of ceramicware is used, the type and temperature of the food it
holds, and how long the food stays in contact with the piece. For example, cups, mugs,
and pitchers have the most stringent action level, 0.5 parts per million, because they
can be expected to hold food longer, allowing more time for lead to leach. Also, a
pitcher may be used to hold fruit juice. And a coffee mug is generally used every day to
hold a hot acidic beverage, often several times a day.
The FDA allows use of lead glazes because they’re the most durable, but regulates
them tightly to ensure their safety. Commercial manufacturers employ extremely strict
and effective manufacturing controls that keep the lead from leaching during use.
Small potters often can’t control the firing of lead glazes as well so their ceramics are
more likely to leach illegal lead levels, although many do use lead-free glazes.
In 21 CFR 109.16, FDA requires high-lead-leaching decorative ceramicware to be
permanently labeled that it’s not for food use and may poison food. Such items bought
outside the United States may not be so labeled, potentially posing serious risk if used
for food.
Pewter refers to a number of silver-gray alloys of tin containing various amounts of
antimony, copper, and lead. The same concerns about the leaching of heavy metals
and lead that apply to brass, galvanized metals, copper, cast iron, ceramics, and crystal
also apply to pewter. As previously stated, the storage of acidic moist foods in pewter
containers could result in food poisoning (heavy metal poisoning).
Solder is a material that is used to join metallic parts and is applied in the melted state
to solid metals. Solder may be composed of tin and lead alloys.
4-101.14 Copper, Use Limitation.
High concentrations of copper are poisonous and have caused foodborne illness.
When copper and copper alloy surfaces contact acidic foods, copper may be leached
into the food. Carbon dioxide may be released into a water supply because of an
ineffective or nonexistent backflow prevention device between a carbonator and copper
plumbing components. The acid that results from mixing water and carbon dioxide
leaches copper from the plumbing components and the leachate is then transferred to
beverages, causing copper poisoning. Backflow prevention devices constructed of
copper and copper alloys can cause, and have resulted in, the leaching of both copper
and lead into carbonated beverages.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
485
 












Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and contains lead which is used to combine the two
elements. Historically, brass has been used for items such as pumps, pipe fitting, and
goblets. All 3 constituents are subject to leaching when they contact acidic foods, and
food poisoning has resulted from such contact.
The steps in beer brewing include malting, mashing, fermentation, separation of the
alcoholic beverage from the mash, and rectification. During mashing, it is essential to
lower the pH from its normal 5.8 in order to optimize enzymatic activity. The pH is
commonly lowered to 5.1-5.2, but may be adjusted to as low as 3.2. The soluble
extract of the mash (wort) is boiled with hops for 1 to 22 hours or more. After boiling,
the wort is cooled, inoculated with brewers yeast, and fermented. The use of copper
equipment during the prefermentation and fermentation steps typically result in some
leaching of copper.
Because copper is an essential nutrient for yeast growth, low levels of copper are
metabolized by the yeast during fermentation. However, studies have shown that
copper levels above 0.2 mg/L are toxic or lethal to the yeast. In addition, copper levels
as low as 3.5 mg/L have been reported to cause symptoms of copper poisoning in
humans. Therefore, the levels of copper necessary for successful beer fermentation
(i.e., below 0.2 mg/L) do not reach a level that would be toxic to humans.
Today, domestic beer brewers typically endeavor to use only stainless steel or stainless
steel-lined copper equipment (piping, fermenters, filters, holding tanks, bottling
machines, keys, etc.) in contact with beer following the hot brewing steps in the beer
making process. Some also use pitch-coated oak vats or glass-lined steel vats
following the hot brewing steps. Where copper equipment is not used in beer brewing, it
is common practice to add copper (along with zinc) to provide the nutrients essential to
the yeast for successful fermentation.
4-101.15 Galvanized Metal, Use Limitation.
Galvanized means iron or steel coated with zinc. Metals such as iron and steel are
coated with zinc to prevent rusting. Under certain conditions, zinc may leach from
galvanized food-contact surfaces into foods that are high in water content. The risk of
leaching increases with increased acidity of foods contacting the galvanized foodcontact surface. On contact with acidic foods and beverages, the zinc may be
converted to zinc salts which are readily absorbed by the body
Zinc is generally considered to be non-toxic, and in fact is a required mineral for many
processes that occur in the human body. However, zinc is known to be toxic when
ingested in large quantities. Symptoms of zinc poisoning include vomiting, nausea,
lethargy, fatigue, and epigastric pain. Most reports of zinc poisoning implicate
contaminated food that resulted from storage in a galvanized metal container.

Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
486
 








4-101.16 Sponges, Use Limitation.
Sponges are difficult, if not impossible, to clean once they have been in contact with
food particles and contaminants that are found in the use environment. Because of
their construction, sponges provide harborage for any number and variety of
microbiological organisms, many of which may be pathogenic. Therefore, sponges are
to be used only where they will not contaminate cleaned and sanitized or in-use, foodcontact surfaces such as for cleaning equipment and utensils before rinsing and
sanitizing.
4-101.17 Wood, Use Limitation.
The limited acceptance of the use of wood as a food-contact surface is determined by
the nature of the food and the type of wood used. Moist foods may cause the wood
surface to deteriorate and the surface may become difficult to clean. In addition, wood
that is treated with preservatives may result in illness due to the migration of the
preservative chemicals to the food; therefore, only specific preservatives are allowed.
4-101.18 Nonstick Coatings, Use Limitation.
Perfluorocarbon resin is a tough, nonporous and stable plastic material that gives
cookware and bakeware a surface to which foods will not stick and that cleans easily
and quickly. FDA has approved the use of this material as safe for food-contact
surfaces. The Agency has determined that neither the particles that may chip off nor
the fumes given off at high temperatures pose a health hazard. However, because this
nonstick finish may be scratched by sharp or rough-edged kitchen tools, the
manufacturer's recommendations should be consulted and the use of utensils that may
scratch, abrasive scouring pads, or cleaners avoided.
4-101.19 Nonfood-Contact Surfaces.
Nonfood-contact surfaces of equipment routinely exposed to splash or food debris are
required to be constructed of nonabsorbent materials to facilitate cleaning. Equipment
that is easily cleaned minimizes the presence of pathogenic organisms, moisture, and
debris and deters the attraction of rodents and insects.
Single-Service
and Single-Use
4-102.11 Characteristics.
The safety and quality of food can be adversely affected through single service and
single use articles that are not constructed of acceptable materials. The migration of
components of those materials to food they contact could result in chemical
contamination and illness to the consumer. In addition, the use of unacceptable
materials could adversely affect the quality of the food because of odors, tastes, and
colors transferred to the food.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
487
 






Durability and
Strength
4-201.11 Equipment and Utensils.
Equipment and utensils must be designed and constructed to be durable and capable
of retaining their original characteristics so that such items can continue to fulfill their
intended purpose for the duration of their life expectancy and to maintain their easy
cleanability. If they can not maintain their original characteristics, they may become
difficult to clean, allowing for the harborage of pathogenic microorganisms, insects, and
rodents. Equipment and utensils must be designed and constructed so that parts do
not break and end up in food as foreign objects or present injury hazards to consumers.
A common example of presenting an injury hazard is the tendency for tines of poorly
designed single service forks to break during use.
4-201.12 Food Temperature Measuring Devices.
Food temperature measuring devices that have glass sensors or stems present a
likelihood that glass will end up in food as a foreign object and create an injury hazard
to the consumer. In addition, the contents of the temperature measuring device, e.g.,
mercury, may contaminate food or utensils.
Cleanability 4-202.11 Food-Contact Surfaces.
The purpose of the requirements for multiuse food-contact surfaces is to ensure that
such surfaces are capable of being easily cleaned and accessible for cleaning. Foodcontact surfaces that do not meet these requirements provide a potential harbor for
foodborne pathogenic organisms. Surfaces which have imperfections such as cracks,
chips, or pits allow microorganisms to attach and form biofilms. Once established,
these biofilms can release pathogens to food. Biofilms are highly resistant to cleaning
and sanitizing efforts. The requirement for easy disassembly recognizes the reluctance
of food employees to disassemble and clean equipment if the task is difficult or requires
the use of special, complicated tools.
4-202.12 CIP Equipment.
Certain types of equipment are designed to be cleaned in place (CIP) where it is difficult
or impractical to disassemble the equipment for cleaning. Because of the closed nature
of the system, CIP cleaning must be monitored via access points to ensure that
cleaning has been effective throughout the system.
The CIP design must ensure that all food-contact surfaces of the equipment are
contacted by the circulating cleaning and sanitizing solutions. Dead spots in the
system, i.e., areas which are not contacted by the cleaning and sanitizing solutions,
could result in the buildup of food debris and growth of pathogenic microorganisms.
There is equal concern that cleaning and sanitizing solutions might be retained in the
system, which may result in the inadvertent adulteration of food. Therefore, the CIP
system must be self-draining.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
488
 








4-202.13 "V" Threads, Use Limitation.
V-type threads present a surface which is difficult to clean routinely; therefore, they are
not allowed on food-contact surfaces. The exception provided for hot oil cooking fryers
and filtering systems is based on the high temperatures that are used in this equipment.
The high temperature in effect sterilizes the equipment, including debris in the "V"
threads.
4-202.14 Hot Oil Filtering Equipment.
To facilitate and ensure effective cleaning of this equipment, Code requirements,
§§ 4-202.11 and 4-202.12 must be followed. The filter is designed to keep the oil free
of undesired materials and therefore must be readily accessible for replacement.
Filtering the oil reduces the likelihood that off-odors, tastes, and possibly toxic
compounds may be imparted to food as a result of debris buildup. To ensure that
filtering occurs, it is necessary for the filter to be accessible for replacement.
4-202.15 Can Openers.
Once can openers become pitted or the surface in any way becomes uncleanable, they
must be replaced because they can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
Can openers must be designed to facilitate replacement.
4-202.16 Nonfood-Contact Surfaces.
Hard-to-clean areas could result in the attraction and harborage of insects and rodents
and allow the growth of foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Well-designed
equipment enhances the ability to keep nonfood-contact surfaces clean.
4-202.17 Kick Plates, Removable.
The use of kick plates is required to allow access for proper cleaning. If kick plate
design and installation does not meet Code requirements, debris could accumulate and
create a situation that may attract insects and rodents.
Accuracy 4-203.11 Temperature Measuring Devices, Food.
The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (amended 1988, 1996, and 2004, 15 USC 205a et
seq) requires that all Federal government regulations use the Celsius scale for
temperature measurement. The Fahrenheit scale is included in the Code for those
jurisdictions using the Fahrenheit scale for temperature measurement.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
489
 











The small margin of error specified for thermometer accuracy is due to the lack of a
large safety margin in the temperature requirements themselves. The accuracy
specified for a particular food temperature measuring device is applicable to its entire
range of use, that is, from refrigeration through cooking temperatures if the device is
intended for such use.
4-203.12 Temperature Measuring Devices, Ambient Air
and Water.
A temperature measuring device used to measure the air temperature in a refrigeration
unit is not required to be as accurate as a food thermometer because the unit's
temperature fluctuates with repeated opening and closing of the door and because
accuracy in measuring internal food temperatures is of more significance.
The Celsius scale is the federally recognized scale based on The Metric Conversion Act
of 1975 (amended 1988, 1996, and 2004, 15 USC 205a et seq) which requires the use
of metric values. The ±1.5o
C requirement is more stringent than the 3o
F previously
required since ±1.5o
C is equivalent to ±2.7o
F. The more rigid accuracy results from the
practical application of metric equivalents to the temperature gradations of Celsius
thermometers.
If Fahrenheit thermometers are used, the 3o
F requirement applies because of the
calibrated intervals of Fahrenheit thermometers.
The accuracy specified for a particular air or water temperature measuring device is
applicable to its intended range of use. For example, a cold holding unit may have a
temperature measuring device that measures from a specified frozen temperature to
20o
C (68o
F). The device must be accurate to specifications within that use range.
4-203.13	 Pressure Measuring Devices, Mechanical
Warewashing Equipment.
Flow pressure is a very important factor with respect to the efficacy of sanitization. A
pressure below the design pressure results in inadequate spray patterns and
incomplete coverage of the utensil surfaces to be sanitized. Excessive flow pressure
will tend to atomize the water droplets needed to convey heat into a vapor mist that
cools before reaching the surfaces to be sanitized.
Functionality 4-204.11 Ventilation Hood Systems, Drip Prevention.
The dripping of grease or condensation onto food constitutes adulteration and may
involve contamination of the food with pathogenic organisms. Equipment, utensils,
linens, and single service and single use articles that are subjected to such drippage
are no longer clean.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
490
 





4-204.12	 Equipment Openings, Closures and
Deflectors.
Equipment openings and covers must be designed to protect stored or prepared food
from contaminants and foreign matter that may fall into the food. The requirement for
an opening to be flanged upward and for the cover to overlap the opening and be
sloped to drain prevents contaminants, especially liquids, from entering the food-contact
area.
Some equipment may have parts that extend into the food-contact areas. If these parts
are not provided with a watertight joint at the point of entry into the food-contact area,
liquids may contaminate the food by adhering to shafts or other parts and running or
dripping into the food.
An apron on parts extending into the food-contact area is an acceptable alternative to
the watertight seal. If the apron is not properly designed and installed, condensation,
drips, and dust may gain access to the food.
4-204.13	 Dispensing Equipment, Protection of
Equipment and Food.
This requirement is intended to protect both the machine-dispensed, unpackaged, liquid
foods and the machine components from contamination. Barriers need to be provided
so that the only liquid entering the food container is the liquid intended to be dispensed
when the machine's mechanism is activated. Recessing of the machine's components
and self-closing doors prevent contamination of machine ports by people, dust, insects,
or rodents. If the equipment components become contaminated, the product itself will
be exposed to possible contamination.
A direct opening into the food being dispensed allows dust, vermin, and other
contaminants access to the food.
NSF/ANSI 18-Manual Food and Beverage Dispensing Equipment is the standard for
manual food and beverage dispensing equipment which has been designed to maintain
the safety of aseptically packaged fluid foods without refrigeration even after the
hermetic seal is broken.
NSF/ANSI 18 was revised in 2006 to specifically address dispensing equipment
designed to hold time/temperature control for safety food or beverages in a
homogeneous liquid form without temperature control. NSF/ANSI 18 requires that such
equipment designs include a number of safeguards that prevent the contamination of
specially packaged food stored within the dispensing equipment. The Standard also
requires that the dispensing equipment have lockout mechanisms that preclude the
dispensing of the product if such safeguards fail or if a prescribed duration of storage is
exceeded.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
491
 



The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recognizes NSF/ANSI 18 as the sole
American National Standard for the sanitary design of manual food and beverage
dispensers.
4-204.14 Vending Machine, Vending Stage Closure.
Since packaged foods dispensed from vending machines could attract insects and
rodents, a self-closing door is required as a barrier to their entrance.
4-204.15 Bearings and Gear Boxes, Leakproof.
It is not unusual for food equipment to contain bearings and gears. Lubricants
necessary for the operation of these types of equipment could contaminate food or
food-contact surfaces if the equipment is not properly designed and constructed.
4-204.16 Beverage Tubing, Separation.
Beverage tubing and coldplate cooling devices may result in contamination if they are
installed in direct contact with stored ice. Beverage tubing installed in contact with ice
may result in condensate and drippage contaminating the ice as the condensate moves
down the beverage tubing and ends up in the ice.
The presence of beverage tubing and/or coldplate cooling devices also presents
cleaning problems. It may be difficult to adequately clean the ice bin if they are present.
Because of the high moisture environment, mold and algae may form on the surface of
the ice bins and any tubing or equipment stored in the bins.
4-204.17 Ice Units, Separation of Drains.
Liquid waste drain lines passing through ice machines and storage bins present a risk
of contamination due to potential leakage of the waste lines and the possibility that
contaminants will gain access to the ice through condensate migrating along the
exterior of the lines.
Liquid drain lines passing through the ice bin are, themselves, difficult to clean and
create other areas that are difficult to clean where they enter the unit as well as where
they abut other surfaces. The potential for mold and algal growth in this area is very
likely due to the high moisture environment. Molds and algae that form on the drain
lines are difficult to remove and present a risk of contamination to the ice stored in the
bin.

4-204.18 Condenser Unit, Separation.
A dust-proof barrier between a condenser and food storage areas of equipment
protects food and food-contact areas from contamination by dust that is accumulated
and blown about as a result of the condenser's operation.
4-204.19 Can Openers on Vending Machines.
Since the cutting or piercing surfaces of a can opener directly contact food in the
container being opened, these surfaces must be protected from contamination.
4-204.110 Molluscan Shellfish Tanks.
Shellfish are filter feeders allowing concentration of pathogenic microorganisms that
may be present in the water. Due to the number of shellfish and the limited volume of
water used, display tanks may allow concentration of pathogenic viruses and bacteria.
Since many people eat shellfish either raw or lightly cooked, the potential for increased
levels of pathogenic microorganisms in shellfish held in display tanks is of concern. If
shellfish stored in molluscan shellfish tanks are offered for consumption, certain
safeguards must be in place as specified in a detailed HACCP plan that is approved by
the regulatory authority. Opportunities for contamination must be controlled or
eliminated. Procedures must emphasize strict monitoring of the water quality of the
tank including the filtering and disinfection system.
4-204.111 Vending Machines, Automatic Shutoff.
Failure to store time/temperature control for safety food at safe temperatures in a
vending machine could result in the growth of pathogenic microorganisms that may
result in foodborne illness. The presence of an automatic control that prevents the
vending of food if the temperature of the unit exceeds Code requirements precludes the
vending of foods that may not be safe.
It is possible and indeed very likely that the temperature of the storage area of a
vending machine may exceed Code requirements during the stocking and servicing of
the machine. The automatic shut off, commonly referred to as the "public health
control,” provides a limited amount of time that the ambient temperature of a machine
may exceed Code requirements. Strict adherence to the time requirements can limit
the growth of pathogenic microorganisms.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
493
 









4-204.112 Temperature Measuring Devices.
The placement of the temperature measuring device is important. If the device is
placed in the coldest location in the storage unit, it may not be representative of the
temperature of the unit. Food could be stored in areas of the unit that exceed Code
requirements. Therefore, the temperature measuring device must be placed in a
location that is representative of the actual storage temperature of the unit to ensure
that all time/temperature control for safety foods are stored at least at the minimum
temperature required in Chapter 3.
Installing an air thermometer in some open display refrigerators can be difficult without
physically impairing the usability of the case and interfering with cleaning and sanitation.
Use of a temperature monitoring system that uses probe-like sensors that are placed in
material resembling the density of food is an acceptable alternative. Thus, the direct
temperature of the substitute product is measured by use of this product mimicking
method.
A permanent temperature measuring device is required in any unit storing
time/temperature control for safety food because of the potential growth of pathogenic
microorganisms should the temperature of the unit exceed Code requirements. In
order to facilitate routine monitoring of the unit, the device must be clearly visible.
The exception to requiring a temperature measuring device for the types of equipment
listed is primarily due to equipment design and function. It would be difficult and
impractical to permanently mount a temperature measuring device on the equipment
listed. The futility of attempting to measure the temperature of unconfined air such as
with heat lamps and, in some cases, the brief period of time the equipment is used for a
given food negate the usefulness of ambient temperature monitoring at that point. In
such cases, it would be more practical and accurate to measure the internal
temperature of the food.
The importance of maintaining time/temperature control for safety foods at the specified
temperatures requires that temperature measuring devices be easily readable. The
inability to accurately read a thermometer could result in food being held at unsafe
temperatures.
Temperature measuring devices must be appropriately scaled per Code requirements
to ensure accurate readings.
The required incremental gradations are more precise for food measuring devices than
for those used to measure ambient temperature because of the significance at a given
point in time, i.e., the potential for pathogenic growth, versus the unit's temperature.
The food temperature will not necessarily match the ambient temperature of the storage
unit; it will depend on many variables including the temperature of the food when it is
placed in the unit, the temperature at which the unit is maintained, and the length of
time the food is stored in the unit.

4-204.113	 Warewashing Machine, Data Plate Operating
Specifications.
The data plate provides the operator with the fundamental information needed to
ensure that the machine is effectively washing, rinsing, and sanitizing equipment and
utensils. The warewashing machine has been tested, and the information on the data
plate represents the parameters that ensure effective operation and sanitization and
that need to be monitored.
4-204.114 Warewashing Machines, Internal Baffles.
The presence of baffles or curtains separating the various operational cycles of a
warewashing machine such as washing, rinsing, and sanitizing are designed to reduce
the possibility that solutions from one cycle may contaminate solutions in another. The
baffles or curtains also prevent food debris from being splashed onto the surface of
equipment that has moved to another cycle in the procedure.
4-204.115	 Warewashing Machines, Temperature
Measuring Devices.
The requirement for the presence of a temperature measuring device in each tank of
the warewashing machine is based on the importance of temperature in the sanitization
step. In hot water machines, it is critical that minimum temperatures be met at the
various cycles so that the cumulative effect of successively rising temperatures causes
the surface of the item being washed to reach the required temperature for sanitization.
When chemical sanitizers are used, specific minimum temperatures must be met
because the effectiveness of chemical sanitizers is directly affected by the temperature
of the solution.
4-204.116	 Manual Warewashing Equipment, Heaters
and Baskets.
Hot water sanitization is accomplished in water of not less than 77o
C (170o
F) and an
integral heating device is necessary to ensure that the minimum temperature is
reached.
The rack or basket is required in order to safely handle the equipment and utensils
being washed and to ensure immersion. Water at this temperature could result in
severe burns to employees operating the equipment.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
495
 












4-204.117	 Warewashing Machines, Automatic
Dispensing of Detergents and Sanitizers.
The presence of adequate detergents and sanitizers is necessary to effect clean and
sanitized utensils and equipment. The automatic dispensing of these chemical agents,
plus a method such as a flow indicator, flashing light, buzzer, or visible open air delivery
system that alerts the operator that the chemicals are no longer being dispensed,
ensures that utensils are subjected to an efficacious cleaning and sanitizing regimen.
4-204.118	 Warewashing Machines, Flow Pressure
Device.
Flow pressure is a very important factor impacting the efficacy of sanitization in
machines that use fresh hot water at line-pressure as a final sanitization rinse. (See
discussion in Public Health Reason for section 4-203.13.) It is important that the
operator be able to monitor, and the food inspector be able to check, final sanitization
rinse pressure as well as machine water temperatures. ANSI/NSF Standard #3, a
national voluntary consensus standard for Commercial Spray-Type Dishwashing
Machines, specifies that a pressure gauge or similar device be provided on this type
machine and such devices are shipped with machines by the manufacturer. Flow
pressure devices installed on the upstream side of the control (solenoid) valve are
subject to damage and failure due to the water hammer effect caused throughout the
dishwashing period each time the control valve closes. The IPS valve provides a ready
means for checking line-pressure with an alternative pressure measuring device. A flow
pressure device is not required on machines that use only a pumped or recirculated
sanitizing rinse since an appropriate pressure is ensured by a pump and is not
dependent upon line-pressure.
4-204.121	 Vending Machines, Liquid Waste Products.
The presence of internal waste containers allows for the collection of liquids that spill
within the vending machine. Absence of a waste container or, where required, a shutoff
valve which controls the incoming liquids could result in wastes spilling within the
machine, causing a condition that attracts insects and rodents and compounds cleaning
and maintenance problems.
4-204.122 Case Lot Handling Equipment, Movability.
Proper design of case lot handling equipment facilitates moving case lots for cleaning
and for surveillance of insect or rodent activity.
4-204.123	 Vending Machine Doors and Openings.
The objective of this requirement is to provide a barrier against the entrance into
vending machines of insects, rodents, and dust. The maximum size of the openings
deters the entrance of common pests.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
496
 








Acceptability 4-205.10	 Food Equipment, Certification and
Classification.
Under ANSI document CA-1 ANSI Policy and Criteria for Accreditation of Certification
Programs, it has been stipulated that:
"For food equipment programs, standards that establish sanitation requirements shall
be specified government standards or standards that have been ratified by a public
health approval step. ANSI shall verify that this requirement has been met by
communicating with appropriate standards developing organizations and governmental
public health bodies."
The term certified is used when an item of food equipment has been evaluated against
an organization's own standard. The term classified is used when one organization
evaluates an item of food equipment against a standard developed by another
organization.
Equipment 4-301.11 Cooling, Heating, and Holding Capacities.
The ability of equipment to cool, heat, and maintain time/temperature control for safety
foods at Code-required temperatures is critical to food safety. Improper holding and
cooking temperatures continue to be major contributing factors to foodborne illness.
Therefore, it is very important to have adequate hot or cold holding equipment with
enough capacity to meet the heating and cooling demands of the operation.
4-301.12	 Manual Warewashing, Sink Compartment
Requirements.
The 3 compartment requirement allows for proper execution of the 3-step manual
warewashing procedure. If properly used, the 3 compartments reduce the chance of
contaminating the sanitizing water and therefore diluting the strength and efficacy of the
chemical sanitizer that may be used.
Alternative manual warewashing equipment, allowed under certain circumstances and
conditions, must provide for accomplishment of the same 3 steps:
1. Application of cleaners and the removal of soil;
2. Removal of any abrasive and removal or dilution of cleaning chemicals; and
3. Sanitization.
Refer also to the public health reason for § 4-603.16.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
497
 










4-301.13 Drainboards.
Drainboards or equivalent equipment are necessary to separate soiled and cleaned
items from each other and from the food preparation area in order to preclude
contamination of cleaned items and of food.
Drainboards allow for the control of water running off equipment and utensils that have
been washed and also allow the operator to properly store washed equipment and
utensils while they air-dry.
4-301.14 Ventilation Hood Systems, Adequacy.
If a ventilation system is inadequate, grease and condensate may build up on the
floors, walls and ceilings of the food establishment, causing an insanitary condition and
possible deterioration of the surfaces of walls and ceilings. The accumulation of grease
and condensate may contaminate food and food-contact surfaces as well as present a
possible fire hazard.
Refer also to the public health reason for § 4-204.11.
4-301.15 Clothes Washers and Dryers.
To protect food, soiled work clothes or linens must be efficiently laundered. The only
practical way of efficiently laundering work clothes on the premises is with the use of a
mechanical washer and dryer.
Refer also to the public health reason for § 4-401.11.
Utensils,
Temperature
Measuring
Devices, and
Testing Devices
4-302.11 Utensils, Consumer Self-Service.
Appropriate serving utensils provided at each container will, among other things, reduce
the likelihood of food tasting, use of fingers to serve food, use of fingers to remove the
remains of one food on the utensil so that it may be used for another, use of soiled
tableware to transfer food, and cross contamination between foods, including a raw
food to a cooked time/temperature control for safety food.
4-302.12 Food Temperature Measuring Devices.
The presence and accessibility of food temperature measuring devices is critical to the
effective monitoring of food temperatures. Proper use of such devices provides the
operator or person in charge with important information with which to determine if
temperatures should be adjusted or if foods should be discarded.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
498
 







When determining the temperature of thin foods, those having a thickness less than
13 mm (1/2 inch), it is particularly important to use a temperature sensing probe
designed for that purpose. Bimetal, bayonet style thermometers are not suitable for
accurately measuring the temperature of thin foods such as hamburger patties because
of the large diameter of the probe and the inability to accurately sense the temperature
at the tip of the probe. However, temperature measurements in thin foods can be
accurately determined using a small-diameter probe 1.5 mm (0.059 inch), or less,
connected to a device such as thermocouple thermometer.
4-302.13 Temperature Measuring Devices, Manual
Warewashing.
Water temperature is critical to sanitization in warewashing operations. This is
particularly true if the sanitizer being used is hot water. The effectiveness of cleaners
and chemical sanitizers is also determined by the temperature of the water used. A
temperature measuring device is essential to monitor manual warewashing and ensure
sanitization.
Effective mechanical hot water sanitization occurs when the surface temperatures of
utensils passing through the warewashing machine meet or exceed the required
71°C(160°F). Parameters such as water temperature, rinse pressure, and time
determine whether the appropriate surface temperature is achieved. Although the Food
Code requires integral temperature measuring devices and a pressure gauge for hot
water mechanical warewashers, the measurements displayed by these devices may not
always be sufficient to determine that the surface temperatures of utensils are reaching
71°C(160°F). The regular use of irreversible registering temperature indicators
provides a simple method to verify that the hot water mechanical sanitizing operation is
effective in achieving a utensil surface temperature of 71ºC (160ºF).
4-302.14 Sanitizing Solutions, Testing Devices.
Testing devices to measure the concentration of sanitizing solutions are required for
2 reasons:
1. The use of chemical sanitizers requires minimum concentrations of the sanitizer
during the final rinse step to ensure sanitization; and
2. Too much sanitizer in the final rinse water could be toxic.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
499
 





Location 4-401.11 Equipment, Clothes Washers and Dryers, and
Storage Cabinets, Contamination Prevention.
Food equipment and the food that contacts the equipment must be protected from
sources of overhead contamination such as leaking or ruptured water or sewer pipes,
dripping condensate, and falling objects. When equipment is installed, it must be
situated with consideration of the potential for contamination from such overhead
sources.
If a clothes washer and dryer are installed adjacent to exposed food, clean equipment,
utensils, linens, and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles, it could result in
those items becoming contaminated from soiled laundry. The reverse is also true, i.e.,
items being laundered could become contaminated from the surrounding area if the
washer and dryer are not properly located.
Installation 4-402.11	 Fixed Equipment, Spacing or Sealing.
This section is designed to ensure that fixed equipment is installed in a way that:
1.	 Allows accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above, and underneath the units or
minimizes the need for cleaning due to closely abutted surfaces;
2.	 Ensures that equipment that is subject to moisture is sealed;
3.	 Prevents the harborage of insects and rodents; and
4.	 Provides accessibility for the monitoring of pests.
4-402.12 Fixed Equipment, Elevation or Sealing.
The inability to adequately or effectively clean areas under equipment could create a
situation that may attract insects and rodents and accumulate pathogenic
microorganisms that are transmissible through food.
The effectiveness of cleaning is directly affected by the ability to access all areas to
clean fixed equipment. It may be necessary to elevate the equipment. When elevating
equipment is not feasible or prohibitively expensive, sealing to prevent contamination is
required.
The economic impact of the requirement to elevate display units in retail food stores,
coupled with the fact that the design, weight, and size of such units are not conducive to
casters or legs, led to the exception for certain units located in consumer shopping
areas, provided the floor under the units is kept clean. This exception for retail food
store display equipment including shelving, refrigeration, and freezer units in the
consumer shopping areas requires a rigorous cleaning schedule.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
500
 








Equipment 4-501.11 Good Repair and Proper Adjustment.
Proper maintenance of equipment to manufacturer specifications helps ensure that it
will continue to operate as designed. Failure to properly maintain equipment could lead
to violations of the associated requirements of the Code that place the health of the
consumer at risk. For example, refrigeration units in disrepair may no longer be
capable of properly cooling or holding time/temperature control for safety foods at safe
temperatures.
The cutting or piercing parts of can openers may accumulate metal fragments that
could lead to food containing foreign objects and, possibly, result in consumer injury.
Adequate cleaning and sanitization of dishes and utensils using a warewashing
machine is directly dependent on the exposure time during the wash, rinse, and
sanitizing cycles. Failure to meet manufacturer and Code requirements for cycle times
could result in failure to clean and sanitize. For example, high temperature machines
depend on the buildup of heat on the surface of dishes to accomplish sanitization. If
the exposure time during any of the cycles is not met, the surface of the items may not
reach the time-temperature parameter required for sanitization. Contact time is also
important in warewashing machines that use a chemical sanitizer since the sanitizer
must contact the items long enough for sanitization to occur. In addition, a chemical
sanitizer will not sanitize a dirty dish; therefore, the cycle times during the wash and
rinse phases are critical to sanitization.
4-501.12 Cutting Surfaces.
Cutting surfaces such as cutting boards and blocks that become scratched and scored
may be difficult to clean and sanitize. As a result, pathogenic microorganisms
transmissible through food may build up or accumulate. These microorganisms may be
transferred to foods that are prepared on such surfaces.
4-501.13 Microwave Ovens.
Failure of microwave ovens to meet the CFR standards could result in human exposure
to radiation leakage, resulting in possible medical problems to consumers and
employees using the machines.
4-501.14 Warewashing Equipment, Cleaning
Frequency.
During operation, warewashing equipment is subject to the accumulation of food wastes
and other soils or sources of contamination. In order to ensure the proper cleaning and
sanitization of equipment and utensils, it is necessary to clean the surface of
warewashing equipment before use and periodically throughout the day.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
501
 



4-501.15 Warewashing Machines, Manufacturers'
Operating Instructions.
To ensure properly cleaned and sanitized equipment and utensils, warewashing
machines must be operated properly. The manufacturer affixes a data plate to the
machine providing vital, detailed instructions about the proper operation of the machine
including wash, rinse, and sanitizing cycle times and temperatures which must be
achieved.
4-501.16 Warewashing Sinks, Use Limitation.
If the wash sink is used for functions other than warewashing, such as washing wiping
cloths or washing and thawing foods, contamination of equipment and utensils could
occur.
4-501.17	 Warewashing Equipment, Cleaning Agents.
Failure to use detergents or cleaners in accordance with the manufacturer's label
instructions could create safety concerns for the employee and consumer. For
example, employees could suffer chemical burns, and chemical residues could find
their way into food if detergents or cleaners are used carelessly.
Equipment or utensils may not be cleaned if inappropriate or insufficient amounts of
cleaners or detergents are used.
4-501.18 Warewashing Equipment, Clean Solutions.
Failure to maintain clean wash, rinse, and sanitizing solutions adversely affects the
warewashing operation. Equipment and utensils may not be sanitized, resulting in
subsequent contamination of food.
4-501.19	 Manual Warewashing Equipment, Wash
Solution Temperature.
The wash solution temperature required in the Code is essential for removing organic
matter. If the temperature is below 110o
F, the performance of the detergent may be
adversely affected, e.g., animal fats that may be present on the dirty dishes would not
be dissolved.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
502
 






4-501.110 Mechanical Warewashing Equipment, Wash
Solution Temperature.
The wash solution temperature in mechanical warewashing equipment is critical to
proper operation. The chemicals used may not adequately perform their function if the
temperature is too low. Therefore, the manufacturer's instructions must be followed.
The temperatures vary according to the specific equipment being used.
4-501.111	 Manual Warewashing Equipment, Hot Water
Sanitization Temperatures.
If the temperature during the hot water sanitizing step is less than 77o
C (171o
F),
sanitization will not be achieved. As a result, pathogenic organisms may survive and be
subsequently transferred from utensils to food.
4-501.112 Mechanical Warewashing Equipment, Hot
Water Sanitization Temperatures.
The temperature of hot water delivered from a warewasher sanitizing rinse manifold
must be maintained according to the equipment manufacturer’s specifications and
temperature limits specified in this section to ensure surfaces of multiuse utensils such
as kitchenware and tableware accumulate enough heat to destroy pathogens that may
remain on such surfaces after cleaning.
The surface temperature must reach at least 71ºC (160ºF) as measured by an
irreversible registering temperature measuring device to affect sanitization. When the
sanitizing rinse temperature exceeds 90ºC (194ºF) at the manifold, the water becomes
volatile and begins to vaporize reducing its ability to convey sufficient heat to utensil
surfaces. The lower temperature limits of 74ºC (165ºF) for a stationary rack, single
temperature machine, and 82ºC (180ºF) for other machines are based on the sanitizing
rinse contact time required to achieve the 71ºC (160ºF) utensil surface temperature.
4-501.113	 Mechanical Warewashing Equipment,
Sanitization Pressure.
If the flow pressure of the final sanitizing rinse is less than that required, dispersion of
the sanitizing solution may be inadequate to reach all surfaces of equipment or utensils.

4-501.114 Manual and Mechanical Warewashing
Equipment, Chemical Sanitization
Temperature, pH, Concentration, and
Hardness.
­
With the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the related
Antimicrobial Regulation Technical Correction Act of 1998, Federal regulatory
responsibility for chemical hard surface sanitizers was moved from FDA (CFSAN/OFAS)
to EPA (Office of Pesticides Programs, Antimicrobial Division). As a result, the relevant
Federal regulation has moved from 21 CFR 178.1010 to 40 CFR 180.940. The Food
Code contains provisions that were not captured in either 21 CFR 178.1010 or 40 CFR
180.940, such as pH, temperature, and water hardness. There is need to retain these
provisions in the Code.
The effectiveness of chemical sanitizers can be directly affected by the temperature,
pH, concentration of the sanitizer solution used, and hardness of the water. Provisions
for pH, temperature, and water hardness in section 4-501.114 have been validated to
achieve sanitization; however, these parameters are not always included on EPAregistered labels. Therefore, it is critical to sanitization that the sanitizers are used
consistently with the EPA-registered label, and if pH, temperature, and water hardness
(for quat) are not included on the label, that the solutions meet the standards required
in the Code.
With respect to chemical sanitization, section 4-501.114 addresses the proper use
conditions for the sanitizing solution, i.e., chemical concentration range, pH, and
temperature minimum levels and, with respect to quaternary ammonium compounds
(quats), the maximum hardness level. If these parameters are not as specified in the
Code or on the EPA-registered label, then this provision is violated.
By contrast, paragraph 4-703.11(C) addresses contact time in seconds. For chemical
sanitization, this paragraph is only violated when the specified contact time is not met.
Section 7-204.11 addresses whether or not the chemical agent being applied as a
sanitizer is approved and listed for that use under 40 CFR 180.940.
EPA sanitizer registration assesses compliance with 40 CFR 180.940, therefore if the
product is used at the appropriate concentration for the application on the EPAregistered label, it is not necessary to consult 40 CFR 180.940 for further compliance
verification. If a sanitarian determined that a solution exceeded the concentration for
the application on the EPA-registered label or is used for an application that is not on
the EPA-registered label, section 7-204.11 would be violated.
To summarize, a sanitizing solution that is too weak would be a violation of section
4-501.114. A solution that is too strong would be a violation of section 7-204.11.
Section 7-202.12 would not be violated due to the existence of section 7-204.11 that
specifically addresses the use chemical sanitizers.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
504
 





A variety of hard food contact surface sanitizers such as sodium hypochlorite or
hypochlorous acid, can be generated on-site by technologies known as electrolyzed
water, electro chemically activated water, and electro activated water in pesticide
generating devices. Paragraph 4-501.114(F) addresses the efficacy and use of these
on-site generated solutions and Section 4-703.11 requires that the conditions of use
yields sanitization as defined in paragraph 1-201.10(B), i.e., a 5 log (99.999%)
reduction.
Because EPA does not require registration of solutions generated and used on-site, the
user of the equipment should look to the device manufacturer for data to validate the
efficacy of the solution produced by the device as well as the conditions for use of the
solution (e.g., concentration, temperature, contact time, pH, and other applicable
factors). These data should be available on-site in the food establishment.
Any data used to validate efficacy of on-site generated sanitizer solutions should
include validation testing that includes all factors that could impact the efficacy of the
sanitizer solution, including water hardness, pH, temperature, and a time element
because efficacy can reduce with time. The report should also clearly identify the
minimum acceptable concentration of active ingredient required for that product to pass
the test. This testing is best performed under Good Laboratory Practices. See the EPA
web site at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/monitoring/programs/fifra/glp.html.
According to the web site, “EPA’s Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS)
compliance monitoring program ensures the quality and integrity of test data submitted
to the Agency in support of a pesticide product registration under FIFRA section 5 of
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and pursuant to testing consent agreements
and test rules issued under section 4 of TSCA.”
Verifying the adequacy of chlorine-based solutions can be accomplished on an ongoing basis by confirming that the concentration, temperature, and pH of the sanitizing
solutions comply with paragraph 4-501.114 (A) using acceptable test methods and
equipment.
The manufacturer should provide methods (e.g., test strips, kits, etc.) to verify that the
equipment consistently generates a solution on-site at the necessary concentration to
achieve sanitization.
Devices can be used for years to produce chemicals intended for the washing of fruits
and vegetables, (e.g., hypochlorous acid, ozone, and chlorine dioxide). Other devices
that are capable of producing hard food contact surface cleaning and sanitizing
solutions on-site (e.g., chlorine, hypochlorous acid that are generated by processes
known as electrolyzed water, electro chemically activated water, and electro activated
water).
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
505
 




A device used to generate hard food contact surface sanitizers on-site is considered a
pesticide device. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a device in 40
CFR 152.500, Requirements for devices, as “(a) A device is defined as any instrument
or contrivance (other than a firearm) intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or
mitigating any pest or any other form of plant or animal life (other than man and other
than a bacterium, virus, or other microorganism on or in living man or living animals) but
not including equipment used for the application of pesticides (such as tamper-resistant
bait boxes for rodenticides) when sold separately therefrom.”
The EPA does not require the registration of pesticide devices; however, these devices
must be produced in a registered establishment. The data plate should list the
establishment number. Additionally, device label requirements are established by
section 2(q)(1) and section 12 of Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), as well as 40 CFR 152.500 Requirements for Devices and 156.10 Labeling
Requirements. No statement that is false or misleading can appear in a device's
labeling. Statements that are subject to this regulation include, but are not limited to:
 The name, brand, or trademark under which the product is sold ·
 An ingredient statement
 Statements concerning effectiveness of the product
 Hazard and precautionary statements for human and domestic animals
 Environmental and exposure hazards
 The directions for use
Maintaining and cleaning devices used for the on-site generation of sanitizing solutions
in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications will help to ensure that they continue
to generate the sanitizer chemicals in the form and concentration for which their
efficacy was assessed.
4-501.115	 Manual Warewashing Equipment, Chemical
Sanitization Using Detergent-Sanitizers.
Some chemical sanitizers are not compatible with detergents when a 2 compartment
operation is used. When using a sanitizer that is different from the detergent-sanitizer
of the wash compartment, the sanitizer may be inhibited by carry-over, resulting in
inadequate sanitization.
4-501.116 Warewashing Equipment, Determining
Chemical Sanitizer Concentration.
The effectiveness of chemical sanitizers is determined primarily by the concentration
and pH of the sanitizer solution. Therefore, a test kit is necessary to accurately
determine the concentration of the chemical sanitizer solution.

Utensils and
Temperature
and Pressure
Measuring Devices
4-502.11 Good Repair and Calibration.
A utensil or food temperature measuring device can act as a source of contamination to
the food it contacts if it is not maintained in good repair. Also, if temperature or
pressure measuring devices are not maintained in good repair, the accuracy of the
readings is questionable. Consequently, a temperature problem may not be detected,
or conversely, a corrective action may be needlessly taken.
4-502.12	 Single-Service and Single-Use Articles,
Required Use.
In situations in which the reuse of multiuse items could result in foodborne illness to
consumers, single-service and single-use articles must be used to ensure safety.
4-502.13 Single-Service and Single-Use Articles, Use
Limitation.
Articles that are not constructed of multiuse materials may not be reused as they are
unable to withstand the rigors of multiple uses, including the ability to be subjected to
repeated washing, rinsing, and sanitizing.
4-502.14 Shells, Use Limitation.
The reuse of mollusk and crustacean shells as multiuse utensils is not allowed in food
establishments. This prohibition does not apply to the removal of the oyster or other
species from the shell for preparation, then returning the same animal to the same shell
for service.
The shell itself may be potentially unsafe for use as a food utensil because of residues
from natural and environmental contamination occurring after the mollusk or crustacean
is removed. In addition, natural shells are not durable or easily cleanable as specified
under section 4-502.13. When mollusk or crustacean shells (from commercial sources)
are re-used by filling them with shucked shellfish, the food is considered misleading and
not honestly presented.
Objective 4-601.11 Equipment, Food-Contact Surfaces, NonfoodContact Surfaces, and Utensils.
The objective of cleaning focuses on the need to remove organic matter from foodcontact surfaces so that sanitization can occur and to remove soil from nonfood contact
surfaces so that pathogenic microorganisms will not be allowed to accumulate and
insects and rodents will not be attracted.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
507
 





Frequency 4-602.11 Equipment Food-Contact Surfaces and
Utensils.
Microorganisms may be transmitted from a food to other foods by utensils, cutting
boards, thermometers, or other food-contact surfaces. Food-contact surfaces and
equipment used for time/temperature control for safety foods should be cleaned as
needed throughout the day but must be cleaned no less than every 4 hours to prevent
the growth of microorganisms on those surfaces.
Refrigeration temperatures slow down the generation time of bacterial pathogens,
making it unnecessary to clean every four hours. However, the time period between
cleaning equipment and utensils may not exceed 24 hours. A time-temperature chart is
provided in subparagraph 4-602.11(D)(2) to accommodate operations that use
equipment and utensils in a refrigerated room or area that maintains a temperature
between 41o
F or less and 55o
F.
Surfaces of utensils and equipment contacting food that is not time/temperature control
for safety food such as iced tea dispensers, carbonated beverage dispenser nozzles,
beverage dispensing circuits or lines, water vending equipment, coffee bean grinders,
ice makers, and ice bins must be cleaned on a routine basis to prevent the
development of slime, mold, or soil residues that may contribute to an accumulation of
microorganisms. Some equipment manufacturers and industry associations, e.g.,
within the tea industry, develop guidelines for regular cleaning and sanitizing of
equipment. If the manufacturer does not provide cleaning specifications for foodcontact surfaces of equipment that are not readily visible, the person in charge should
develop a cleaning regimen that is based on the soil that may accumulate in those
particular items of equipment.
Regarding the possible adulteration from one species of meat to another between
cleaning of food-contact surfaces, USDA/FSIS does not automatically consider species
adulteration as a health hazard. FSIS stated in an Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking that species adulteration falls into a gray area between safety and
economic adulteration (65 FR 14486, March 17, 2000, Other Consumer Protection
Activities). FSIS will review public comments received on the species adulteration issue
and further review the scientific literature and risk assessment mechanisms before
declaring species adulteration a health hazard. Meanwhile, species adulteration is
generally considered by FSIS as an economic issue. However, investigations by FSIS
of species adulteration incidents may include a determination regarding the impact of
species adulteration as a health hazard on a case-by-case basis.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
508
 
The 2012 Conference for Food Protection (CFP) requested that FDA amend §4-602.11
of the Food Code to require that equipment food contact surfaces and utensils that
have contacted raw animal foods that are major food allergens be cleaned before use
with other raw animal foods (Issue 2012-III-024). FDA recognizes that in addition to
their intended use as ingredients, the unintended presence of major food allergens in
foods may occur through cross-contact. Cross-contact describes the inadvertent
introduction of an allergen into a product that would not intentionally contain that
allergen as an ingredient. While most cross-contact can be avoided through control of
the environment during food production and preparation, the CFP request only
addresses allergen cross-contact from raw animal foods that are major food allergens
and therefore, falls short of comprehensive allergen cross-contact control for all eight
(8) major food allergens. Although limited in scope, such a change supports the
continued efforts of FDA to work in cooperation with the Conference for Food Protection
toward control of food allergens in retail food establishments. Therefore, §4-602.11 was
amended to require that food contact surfaces of equipment and utensils that have
contacted raw animal foods that are major food allergens, such as raw fish, must be
cleaned and sanitized prior to contacting other types of raw animal foods.
Refer also to Annex 4 - Management of Food Safety Principles for Food Allergens as
Food Safety Hazards.
4-602.12 Cooking and Baking Equipment.
Food-contact surfaces of cooking equipment must be cleaned to prevent encrustations
that may impede heat transfer necessary to adequately cook food. Encrusted
equipment may also serve as an insect attractant when not in use. Because of the
nature of the equipment, it may not be necessary to clean cooking equipment as
frequently as the equipment specified in § 4-602.11.
4-602.13 Nonfood-Contact Surfaces.
The presence of food debris or dirt on nonfood contact surfaces may provide a suitable
environment for the growth of microorganisms which employees may inadvertently
transfer to food. If these areas are not kept clean, they may also provide harborage for
insects, rodents, and other pests.
Methods 4-603.11 Dry Cleaning.
Dry cleaning methods are indicated in only a few operations, which are limited to dry
foods that are not time/temperature control for safety foods. Under some
circumstances, attempts at wet cleaning may create microbiological concerns.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
509
 





4-603.12 Precleaning.
Precleaning of utensils, dishes, and food equipment allows for the removal of grease
and food debris to facilitate the cleaning action of the detergent. Depending upon the
condition of the surface to be cleaned, detergent alone may not be sufficient to loosen
soil for cleaning. Heavily soiled surfaces may need to be presoaked or scrubbed with
an abrasive.
4-603.13	 Loading of Soiled Items, Warewashing
Machines.
Items to be washed in a warewashing machine must receive unobstructed exposure to
the spray to ensure adequate cleaning. Items which are stacked or trays which are
heavily loaded with silverware cannot receive complete distribution of detergent, water,
or sanitizer and cannot be considered to be clean.
4-603.14	 Wet Cleaning.
Because of the variety of cleaning agents available and the many different types of soil
to be removed it is not possible to recommend one cleaning agent to fit all situations.
Each of the different types of cleaners works best under different conditions (i.e., some
work best on grease, some work best in warm water, others work best in hot water).
The specific chemical selected should be compatible with any other chemicals to be
used in the operation such as a sanitizer or drying agent.
4-603.15 Washing, Procedures for Alternative Manual
Warewashing Equipment.
Some pieces of equipment are fixed or too large to be cleaned in a sink. Nonetheless,
cleaning of such equipment requires the application of cleaners for the removal of soil
and rinsing for the removal of abrasive and cleaning chemicals, followed by sanitization.
4-603.16 Rinsing Procedures.
It is important to rinse off detergents, abrasive, and food debris after the wash step to
avoid diluting or inactivating the sanitizer.
Objective 4-701.10 Food-Contact Surfaces and Utensils.
Effective sanitization procedures destroy organisms of public health importance that
may be present on wiping cloths, food equipment, or utensils after cleaning, or which
have been introduced into the rinse solution. It is important that surfaces be clean
before being sanitized to allow the sanitizer to achieve its maximum benefit.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
510
 







Frequency 4-702.11 Before Use After Cleaning.
Sanitization is accomplished after the warewashing steps of cleaning and rinsing so that
utensils and food-contact surfaces are sanitized before coming in contact with food and
before use.
Methods 4-703.11 Hot Water and Chemical.
Efficacious sanitization depends on warewashing being conducted within certain
parameters. Time is a parameter applicable to both chemical and hot water
sanitization. The time hot water or chemicals contact utensils or food-contact surfaces
must be sufficient to destroy pathogens that may remain on surfaces after cleaning.
Other parameters, such as rinse pressure, temperature, and chemical concentration
are used in combination with time to achieve sanitization.
When surface temperatures of utensils passing through warewashing machines using
hot water for sanitizing do not reach the required 71ºC (160ºF), it is important to
understand the factors affecting the decreased surface temperature. A comparison
should be made between the machine manufacturer’s operating instructions and the
machine’s actual wash and rinse temperatures and final rinse pressure. The actual
temperatures and rinse pressure should be consistent with the machine manufacturer’s
operating instructions and within limits specified in §§ 4-501.112 and 4-501.113.
If either the temperature or pressure of the final rinse spray is higher than the specified
upper limit, spray droplets may disperse and begin to vaporize resulting in less heat
delivery to utensil surfaces. Temperatures below the specified limit will not convey the
needed heat to surfaces. Pressures below the specified limit will result in incomplete
coverage of the heat-conveying sanitizing rinse across utensil surfaces.
Objective 4-801.11 Clean Linens.
Linens that are not free from food residues and other soiling matter may carry
pathogenic microorganisms that may cause illness.
Frequency 4-802.11 Specifications.
Linens, cloth gloves, and cloth napkins are to be laundered between uses to prevent
the transfer of pathogenic microorganisms between foods or to food-contact surfaces.
The laundering of wet wiping cloths before being used with a fresh solution of cleanser
or sanitizer is designed to reduce the microbiological load in the cleanser and sanitizer
and thereby reduce the possible transfer of microorganisms to food and nonfoodcontact surfaces.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
511
 


Methods 4-803.11 Storage of Soiled Linens.
Soiled linens may directly or indirectly contaminate food. Proper storage will reduce the
possibility of contamination of food, equipment, utensils, and single-service and singleuse articles.
4-803.12 Mechanical Washing.
Proper laundering of wiping cloths will significantly reduce the possibility that pathogenic
microorganisms will be transferred to food, equipment, or utensils.
4-803.13 Use of Laundry Facilities.
Washing and drying items used in the operation of the establishment on the premises
will help prevent the introduction of pathogenic microorganisms into the environment of
the food establishment.
Drying 4-901.11 Equipment and Utensils, Air-Drying Required.
Items must be allowed to drain and to air-dry before being stacked or stored. Stacking
wet items such as pans prevents them from drying and may allow an environment
where microorganisms can begin to grow. Cloth drying of equipment and utensils is
prohibited to prevent the possible transfer of microorganisms to equipment or utensils.
4-901.12 Wiping Cloths, Air-Drying Locations.
Cloths that are air-dried must be dried so that they do not drip on food or utensils and
so that the cloths are not contaminated while air-drying.
Lubricating and
Reassembling
4-902.11 Food-Contact Surfaces.
Food-contact surfaces must be lubricated in a manner that does not introduce
contaminants to those surfaces.
4-902.12 Equipment.
Equipment must be reassembled in a way that food-contact surfaces are not
contaminated.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
512
 






Storing 4-903.11	 Equipment, Utensils, Linens, and SingleService and Single-Use Articles.
Clean equipment and multiuse utensils which have been cleaned and sanitized,
laundered linens, and single-service and single-use articles can become contaminated
before their intended use in a variety of ways such as through water leakage, pest
infestation, or other insanitary condition.
4-903.12 Prohibitions.
The improper storage of clean and sanitized equipment, utensils, laundered linens, and
single-service and single-use articles may allow contamination before their intended
use. Contamination can be caused by moisture from absorption, flooding, drippage, or
splash. It can also be caused by food debris, toxic materials, litter, dust, and other
materials. The contamination is often related to unhygienic employee practices,
unacceptable high-risk storage locations, or improper construction of storage facilities.
Preventing
Contamination
4-904.11 Kitchenware and Tableware.
4-904.12 Soiled and Clean Tableware.
4-904.13 Preset Tableware.
The presentation or setting of single-service and single-use articles and cleaned and
sanitized utensils shall be done in a manner designed to prevent the contamination of
food- and lip-contact surfaces.
4-904.14	 Rinsing Equipment and Utensils after
Cleaning and Sanitizing.
The rinsing of cleaned and sanitized utensils and equipment in a manner that may
contaminate the surfaces before they are used, such as running them under a faucet or
by dipping them in a vessel of water, is prohibited. The application of a post-sanitizing
rinse is restricted to warewashing machines because there will be little opportunity for
contamination of the potable water rinse if applied within the confines of a compliant
warewashing machine. Provided the sanitization is achieved before the rinse is applied
and as long as any chemical sanitizers are used in accordance with an EPA-registered
label, the sanitary state of utensils and equipment should not be altered by applying a
potable water rinse after the required final sanitizing rinse within a warewashing
machine.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
513
 








Chapter 5 Water, Plumbing, and Waste
Source 5-101.11 Approved System.
Water, unless it comes from a safe supply, may serve as a source of contamination for
food, equipment, utensils, and hands. The major concern is that water may become a
vehicle for transmission of disease organisms. Water can also become contaminated
with natural or man-made chemicals. Therefore, for the protection of consumers and
employees, water must be obtained from a source regulated by law and must be used,
transported, and dispensed in a sanitary manner.
5-101.12 System Flushing and Disinfection.
During construction, repair, or modification, water systems may become contaminated
with microbes from soil because pipes are installed underground or by chemicals
resulting from soldering and welding. Floods and other incidents may also cause water
to become contaminated. Chemical contaminants such as oils may also be present on
or in the components of the system. To render the water safe, the system must be
properly flushed and disinfected before being placed into service.
5-101.13 Bottled Drinking Water.
Bottled water is obtained from a public water system or from a private source such as a
spring or well. Either means of production must be controlled by public health law to
protect the consumer from contaminated water.
Quality 5-102.11 Standards.
Bacteriological and chemical standards have been developed for public drinking water
supplies to protect public health. All drinking water supplies must meet standards
required by law.
5-102.12 Nondrinking Water.
Food establishments may use nondrinking water for purposes such as air-conditioning
or fire protection. Nondrinking water is not monitored for bacteriological and chemical
quality or safety as is drinking water. Consequently, certain safety precautions must be
observed to prevent the contamination of food, drinking water, or food-contact surfaces
by nondrinking water. Identifying the piping designated as nondrinking waterlines and
inspection for cross connections are examples of safety precautions.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
514
 






Irrigation water used in the cultivation of fresh produce, e.g. herb gardens or other
onsite gardens, is another example of nondrinking water. Whenever water comes into
contact with fresh produce, its quality dictates the potential for pathogen contamination.
Water has the potential to be a direct source of contamination and vehicle for spreading
contamination. Research has shown that irrigation water can increase the frequency of
pathogen contamination of harvested produce, and may contain or convey pathogens,
such as Salmonella spp. Where used, irrigation water should be adequate and
approved for its intended use in accordance with Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs)
that minimize the potential for contaminated water to contact the edible portion of the
crop. FDA’s “Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh-cut Fruit and
Vegetables” provides useful information about GAPs and safely growing, harvesting,
washing, sorting, packing and distributing produce. It is available at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati
on/ProducePlantProducts/ucm064458.htm.
5-102.13 Sampling.
Wells and other types of individual water supplies may become contaminated through
faulty equipment or environmental contamination of ground water. Periodic sampling is
required by law to monitor the safety of the water and to detect any change in quality.
The controlling agency must be able to ascertain that this sampling program is active
and that the safety of the water is in conformance with the appropriate standards.
Laboratory results are only as accurate as the sample submitted. Care must be taken
not to contaminate samples. Proper sample collection and timely transportation to the
laboratory are necessary to ensure the safety of drinking water used in the
establishment.
5-102.14 Sample Report.
The most recent water sampling report must be kept on file to document a safe water
supply.
Quantity and
Availability
5-103.11 Capacity.
Availability of sufficient water is a basic requirement for proper sanitation within a food
establishment. An insufficient supply of safe water will prevent the proper cleaning of
items such as equipment and utensils and of food employees' hands.
Hot water required for washing items such as equipment and utensils and employees'
hands, must be available in sufficient quantities to meet demand during peak water
usage periods. Booster heaters for warewashers that use hot water for sanitizing are
designed to raise the temperature of hot water to a level that ensures sanitization. If
the volume of water reaching the booster heater is not sufficient or hot enough, the
required temperature for sanitization can not be reached.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
515
 




Manual washing of food equipment and utensils is most effective when hot water is
used. Unless utensils are clean to sight and touch, they cannot be effectively sanitized.
5-103.12 Pressure.
Inadequate water pressure could lead to situations that place the public health at risk.
For example, inadequate pressure could result in improper handwashing or equipment
operation. Sufficient water pressure ensures that equipment such as mechanical
warewashers operate according to manufacturer's specifications.
Distribution,
Delivery,
and Retention

5-104.11 System.

Inadequate water systems may serve as vehicles for contamination of food or foodcontact surfaces. This requirement is intended to ensure that sufficient volumes of
water are provided from supplies shown to be safe, through a distribution system which
is protected.
5-104.12 Alternative Water Supply.
Water from an approved source can be contaminated if inappropriately conveyed.
Improperly constructed and maintained water mains, pumps, hoses, connections, and
other appurtenances, as well as transport vehicles and containers, may result in
contamination of safe water and render it hazardous to human health.
Materials 5-201.11 Approved.
Plumbing systems and hoses conveying water must be made of approved materials
and be smooth, durable, nonabsorbent, and corrosion-resistant. If not, the system may
constitute a health hazard because unsuitable surfaces may harbor disease organisms
or it may be constructed of materials that may, themselves, contaminate the water
supply.
Design,
Construction,

and Installation

5-202.11 Approved System and Cleanable Fixtures.

Water within a system will leach minute quantities of materials out of the components of
the system. To make sure none of the leached matter is toxic or in a form that may
produce detrimental effects, even through long-term use, all materials and components
used in water systems must be of an approved type. New or replacement items must
be tested and approved based on current standards.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
516
 













Improperly designed, installed, or repaired water systems can have inherent
deficiencies such as improper access openings, dead spaces, and areas difficult or
impossible to clean and disinfect. Dead spaces allow water quality to degrade since
they are out of the constant circulation of the system. Fixtures such as warewashing
sinks that are not easily cleanable may lead to the contamination of food products.
5-202.12 Handwashing Facility, Installation.
Warm water is more effective than cold water in removing the fatty soils encountered in
kitchens. An adequate flow of warm water will cause soap to lather and aid in flushing
soil quickly from the hands. ASTM Standards for testing the efficacy of handwashing
formulations specify a water temperature of 40°C ± 2°C (100 to 108°F).
An inadequate flow or temperature of water may lead to poor handwashing practices by
food employees. A mixing valve or combination faucet is needed to provide properly
tempered water for handwashing. Steam mixing valves are not allowed for this use
because they are hard to control and injury by scalding is a possible hazard.
5-202.13 Backflow Prevention, Air Gap.
During periods of extraordinary demand, drinking water systems may develop negative
pressure in portions of the system. If a connection exists between the system and a
source of contaminated water during times of negative pressure, contaminated water
may be drawn into and foul the entire system. Standing water in sinks, dipper wells,
steam kettles, and other equipment may become contaminated with cleaning chemicals
or food residue. To prevent the introduction of this liquid into the water supply through
back siphonage, various means may be used.
The water outlet of a drinking water system must not be installed so that it contacts
water in sinks, equipment, or other fixtures that use water. Providing an air gap
between the water supply outlet and the flood level rim of a plumbing fixture or
equipment prevents contamination that may be caused by backflow.
5-202.14 Backflow Prevention Device, Design
Standard.
In some instances an air gap is not practical such as is the case on the lower rinse arm
for the final rinse of warewashers. This arm may become submerged if the machine
drain becomes clogged. If this failure occurs, the machine tank would fill to the flood
level rim, which is above the rinse arm. A backflow prevention device is used to avoid
potential backflow of contaminated water when an air gap is not practical. The device
provides a break to the atmosphere in the event of a negative pressure within the
system. Minerals contained in water and solid particulate matter carried in water may
coat moving parts of the device or become lodged between them over time. This may
render the device inoperative.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
517
 






To minimize such an occurrence, only devices meeting certain standards of
construction, installation, maintenance, inspection, and testing for that application may
be used. The necessary maintenance can be facilitated by installing these devices in
accessible locations.
5-202.15 Conditioning Device, Design.
Water conditioning devices must be designed for easy disassembly for servicing so that
they can be maintained in a condition that allows them to perform the function for which
they were designed.
Numbers and
Capacities
5-203.11 Handwashing Sinks.
Because handwashing is such an important intervention in the control of foodborne
illness, sufficient handwashing sinks must be available to make handwashing not only
possible, but likely to occur at all appropriate times and places as outlined in Sections
2-301.14 and 2-301.15.
According to Greig et el. (July 2007) an analysis of 816 reported outbreaks of infected
worker-associated outbreaks from 1927-2006 found that over 61% of these outbreaks
came from food service facilities and catered events, and another 11% of them are
attributed to schools, day care centers and health care institutions. The two most
frequently reported risk factors associated with these implicated food workers was bare
hand contact with food, and failure to properly wash hands.
Green et al (JFP, March 2007) found that handwashing was more likely to occur in
restaurants whose food workers received food safety training, had more than one
handwashing sink, and had a handwashing sink in the observed worker's sight. This
suggests that improving food worker hand hygiene requires more than food safety
education.
5-203.12 Toilets and Urinals.
Adequate, sanitary toilet facilities are necessary for the proper disposal of human
waste, which carries pathogenic microorganisms, and for preventing the spread of
disease by flies and other insects.
5-203.13 Service Sink.
Mop water and similar liquid wastes are contaminated with microorganisms and other
filth. Waste water must be disposed of in a sanitary manner that will not contaminate
food or food equipment. A service sink or curbed cleaning facility with a drain allows for
such disposal.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
518
 








5-203.14	 Backflow Prevention Device, When
Required.
The delivery end of hoses attached to hose bibbs on a drinking water line may be
dropped into containers filled with contaminated water or left in puddles on the floor or
in other possible sources of contamination. A backflow prevention device must be
installed on the hose bibb to prevent the back siphonage of contaminated liquid into the
drinking water system during occasional periods of negative pressure in the water line.
5-203.15 Backflow Prevention Device, Carbonator.
When carbon dioxide is mixed with water, carbonic acid, a weak acid, is formed.
Carbonators on soft drink dispensers form such acids as they carbonate the water to be
mixed with the syrups to produce the soft drinks. If carbon dioxide backs up into a
copper water line, carbonic acid will dissolve some of the copper. The water containing
the dissolved copper will subsequently be used in dispensing soft drinks and the first
few customers receiving the drinks are likely to suffer with the symptoms of copper
poisoning.
An air gap or a vented backflow prevention device meeting ASSE Standard No. 1022
will prevent this occurrence, thereby reducing incidences of copper poisoning.
Location and
Placement
5-204.11 Handwashing Sinks.
Hands are a common vehicle for the transmission of pathogens to foods in an
establishment. Hands can become soiled with a variety of contaminants during routine
operations. The transfer of contaminants can be limited by providing food employees with
handwashing sinks that are properly equipped and conveniently located.
A handwashing sink that is properly located is one that is available to food employees
who are working in food preparation, food dispensing, and warewashing areas.
Handwashing sinks that are blocked by portable equipment or stacked full of soiled
utensils and other items, are rendered unavailable for employee use. Nothing must block
the approach to a handwashing sink thereby discouraging its use, plus it must be kept
clean and well stocked with soap and sanitary towels to facilitate frequent use. Therefore,
a handwashing sink that is located in the immediate work area, or between work areas
that the Code states must be equipped with handwashing sinks, depending upon the size
and function of the facility, would be considered properly located. Such placement of
handwashing sinks facilitates frequent handwashing by food employees in all work areas.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
519
 


5-204.12 Backflow Prevention Device, Location.
Backflow prevention devices are meant to protect the drinking water system from
contamination caused by backflow. If improperly placed, backflow prevention devices
will not work. If inconveniently located, these devices may not be accessed when
systems are extended, altered, serviced, or replaced. Over a period of time, unserviced
devices may fail and system contamination may occur.
5-204.13 Conditioning Device, Location.
When not located for easy maintenance, conditioning devices will be inconvenient to
access and devices such as filters, screens, and water softeners will become clogged
because they are not properly serviced.
Operation and
Maintenance
5-205.11 Using a Handwashing Sink.
Facilities must be maintained in a condition that promotes handwashing and restricted
for that use. Convenient accessibility of a handwashing facility encourages timely
handwashing which provides a break in the chain of contamination from the hands of
food employees to food or food-contact surfaces. Sinks used for food preparation and
warewashing can become sources of contamination if used as handwashing facilities by
employees returning from the toilet or from duties which have contaminated their
hands.
5-205.12 Prohibiting a Cross Connection.
Nondrinking water may be of unknown or questionable origin. Waste water is either
known or suspected to be contaminated. Neither of these sources can be allowed to
contact and contaminate the drinking water system.
5-205.13	 Scheduling Inspection and Service for a
Water System Device.
Water system devices, such as filters and backflow preventers, are affected by the
water in the system. How devices are affected depends on water quality, especially pH,
hardness, and suspended particulate matter in the water. Complexity of the device is
also a factor. Manufacturer recommendations, as well as inspection and maintenance
schedules for these devices, must be strictly followed to prevent failure during
operation.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
520
 









Cleaning 5-205.14 Water Reservoir of Fogging
Devices, Cleaning.
Water reservoirs that have poor water exchange rates, such as reservoirs for some
humidifiers or aerosol or fogging devices, and that are directly or indirectly open to the
atmosphere, may be contaminated with respiratory pathogens such as Legionella
pneumophila. This organism is extremely infectious and can be transmitted through
very small droplets of a fogger or humidifier. It is important that the manufacturer's
cleaning and maintenance schedule be scrupulously followed to prevent a reservoir
from colonization by this bacterium.
5-205.15 System Maintained in Good Repair.
Improper repair or maintenance of any portion of the plumbing system may result in
potential health hazards such as cross connections, backflow, or leakage. These
conditions may result in the contamination of food, equipment, utensils, linens, or
single-service or single-use articles. Improper repair or maintenance may result in the
creation of obnoxious odors or nuisances, and may also adversely affect the operation
of warewashing equipment or other equipment which depends on sufficient volume and
pressure to perform its intended functions.
Materials 5-301.11 Approved.
Materials used in the construction of a mobile water tank are affected by the water they
contact. Tank liners may deteriorate and flake. Metals or platings can be toxic. To
prevent the degradation of the quality of the water, it is important that the materials
used in the construction of the tank are suitable for such use.
Design and
Construction
5-302.11 Enclosed System, Sloped to Drain.
5-302.12 Inspection and Cleaning Port, Protected and
Secured.
The tank must be a closed system from the filling inlet to the outlet to prevent
contamination of water. It is important that the bottom of the tank be sloped to the
outlet to allow the tank to drain completely, to facilitate the proper cleaning and
disinfection of the tank, and to prevent the retention of water or solutions after cleaning.
Some tanks are designed with an access opening to facilitate the cleaning and
servicing of the water tank. The access must be constructed to prevent the opening
from becoming a source of contamination of the water.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
521
 





5-302.13 "V" Type Threads, Use Limitation.
V-type threads are difficult to clean if contaminated with food or waste. To prevent the
contamination of the drinking water, this type of thread should only be used on water
tank inlets and outlets if the connection is permanent which eliminates exposed,
difficult-to-clean threads.
5-302.14 Tank Vent, Protected.
Water tanks are equipped with a vent to preclude distortion during filling or draining.
The vent should be equipped with a suitable screen or filter to protect the tank against
the entry of insects or other vermin that may contaminate the water supply.
5-302.15 Inlet and Outlet, Sloped to Drain.
Both the inlet and outlet must be sloped to drain to prevent the pooling of possibly
contaminated water or sanitizing solution.
5-302.16 Hose, Construction and Identification.
Hoses used to fill potable water tanks should be dedicated for that one task and should
be identified for that use only to prevent contaminating the water. Hoses must be made
of a material that will not leach detrimental substances into the water.
Numbers and
Capacities
5-303.11 Filter, Compressed Air.
Compressor pistons are lubricated with oil to minimize wear. Some of the oil is carried
into the air lines and if not intercepted may contaminate the tank and water lines.
5-303.12 Protective Cover or Device.
Protective equipment provided for openings of the water supply must be in use to
prevent contamination which may be present where the supply is exposed to the
environment, i.e., at water inlets or outlets or the ends of transfer hoses.
5-303.13 Mobile Food Establishment Tank Inlet.
Mobile units may be particularly vulnerable to environmental contamination if soiled
hose connections are coupled to the tank inlet.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

Operation and
Maintenance
5-304.11 System Flushing and Disinfection.
Contaminants of various types may be introduced into a water system during
construction or repair or other incidents. The system must be flushed and sanitized
after maintenance and before it is placed into service to prevent contamination of the
water introduced into the tank.
5-304.12	 Using a Pump and Hoses, Backflow
Prevention.
When a water system includes a pump, or a pump is used in filling a water tank, care
must be taken during hookup to prevent negative pressure on the supplying water
system. Backflow prevention to protect the water supply is especially necessary during
cleaning and sanitizing operations on a mobile system.
5-304.13	 Protecting Inlet, Outlet, and Hose Fitting.
When not connected for use, water inlets, outlets, and hose fittings should be closed to
the environment. Unless capped or otherwise protected, filling inlets, outlets, and
hoses may become contaminated by dust or vermin.
5-304.14	 Tank, Pump, and Hoses, Dedication.
Hoses, pumps, and tanks used for food or water may not be used for other liquids
because this may contaminate the water supply. If a hose, tank, or pump has been
used to transfer liquid food, the equipment must be cleaned and sanitized before using
it for water delivery. Failure to properly clean and sanitize the equipment would
introduce nutrients, and possibly bacteria, into the water as well as inactivate residual
chlorine from public water supplies.
Mobile
Holding
Tank
5-401.11 Capacity and Drainage.
Liquid waste from a mobile or temporary food establishment must be stored in a
properly constructed waste tank to discourage the attraction of flies and other vermin.
The waste tank must be 15% larger than the water storage tank to allow for storage of
wastes and used water from the drinking water supply tank. The drain from the waste
tank must be larger than the filling hose to prevent the use of the drinking water filling
hose to drain the waste tank.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines

Retention,
Drainage, and
Delivery
5-402.10 Establishment Drainage System.
The drainage system must be designed and installed properly to prevent the backup of
sewage and the possible contamination of foods or food-contact surfaces in the
establishment.
5-402.11 Backflow Prevention.
Improper plumbing installation or maintenance may result in potential health hazards
such as cross connections, back siphonage or backflow. These conditions may result
in the contamination of food, utensils, equipment, or other food-contact surfaces. It
may also adversely affect the operation of equipment such as warewashing machines.
The exception in paragraph 5-402.11(B) allows for a direct connection to the sanitary
sewer system for floor drains originating in refrigerated spaces that are constructed as
an integral part of the building structure. Examples of refrigerated spaces that are
considered an integral part of the building include refrigerated prep rooms, meat cutting
rooms, and refrigerated storage rooms. The exception specifically targets refrigerated
spaces that are considered an integral part of the building. It does not apply to
prefabricated walk-in refrigerators and freezers with prefabricated floors. It is not
intended to apply to pieces of equipment, including those which may be located in a
refrigerated room and which indirectly drain to a floor drain within the room. Drainage
from equipment is addressed under paragraph 5-402.11(A).
5-402.12 Grease Trap.
Failure to locate a grease trap so that it can be properly maintained and cleaned could
result in the harborage of vermin and/or the failure of the sewage system.
5-402.13 Conveying Sewage.

5-402.14 Removing Mobile Food Establishment Waste.

Improper disposal of waste provides a potential for contamination of food, utensils, and
equipment and, therefore, may cause serious illness or disease outbreaks. Proper
removal is required to prevent contamination of ground surfaces and water supplies, or
creation of other insanitary conditions that may attract insects and other vermin.
5-402.15 Flushing a Waste Retention Tank.
Thoroughly flushing the liquid waste retention tank will prevent the buildup of deposits
within the tank which could affect the proper operation of the tank.

Disposal
Facility
5-403.11 Approved Sewage Disposal System.
Many diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through fecal
contamination of food and water. This transmission can be indirect. Proper disposal of
human wastes greatly reduces the risk of fecal contamination. This Code provision is
intended to ensure that wastes will not contaminate ground surfaces or water supplies;
pollute surface waters; be accessible to children or pets; or allow rodents or insects to
serve as vectors of disease from this source.
5-403.12 Other Liquid Waste and Rainwater.
Liquid food wastes and rainwater can provide a source of bacterial contamination and
support populations of pests. Proper storage and disposal of wastes and drainage of
rainwater eliminate these conditions.

5-501.116 Cleaning Receptacles.
Proper storage and disposal of garbage and refuse are necessary to minimize the
development of odors, prevent such waste from becoming an attractant and harborage
or breeding place for insects and rodents, and prevent the soiling of food preparation
and food service areas. Improperly handled garbage creates nuisance conditions,
makes housekeeping difficult, and may be a possible source of contamination of food,
equipment, and utensils.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
525
 



Storage areas for garbage and refuse containers must be constructed so that they can
be thoroughly cleaned in order to avoid creating an attractant or harborage for insects
or rodents. In addition, such storage areas must be large enough to accommodate all
the containers necessitated by the operation in order to prevent scattering of the
garbage and refuse.
All containers must be maintained in good repair and cleaned as necessary in order to
store garbage and refuse under sanitary conditions as well as to prevent the breeding
of flies.
Garbage containers should be available wherever garbage is generated to aid in the
proper disposal of refuse.
Outside receptacles must be constructed with tight-fitting lids or covers to prevent the
scattering of the garbage or refuse by birds, the breeding of flies, or the entry of
rodents. Proper equipment and supplies must be made available to accomplish
thorough and proper cleaning of garbage storage areas and receptacles so that
unsanitary conditions can be eliminated.
Removal	 5-502.11 Frequency.
5-502.12 Receptacles or Vehicles.
Refuse, recyclables, and returnable items, such as beverage cans and bottles, usually
contain a residue of the original contents. Spillage from these containers soils
receptacles and storage areas and becomes an attractant for insects, rodents, and
other pests. The handling of these materials entails some of the same problems and
solutions as the handling of garbage and refuse. Problems are minimized when all of
these materials are removed from the premises at a reasonable frequency.
Facilities
for Disposal and
Recycling
5-503.11 Community or Individual Facility.
Alternative means of solid waste disposal must be conducted properly to prevent
environmental consequences and the attraction of insects, rodents, and other pests.
Chapter 6 Physical Facilities
Indoor Areas	 6-101.11 Surface Characteristics.
Floors, walls, and ceilings that are constructed of smooth and durable surface materials
are more easily cleaned.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
526
 




Floor surfaces that are graded to drain and consist of effectively treated materials will
prevent contamination of foods from dust and organisms from pooled moisture.
The special requirements for carpeting materials and nonabsorbent materials in areas
subject to moisture are intended to ensure that the cleanability of these surfaces is
retained.
Although food served from temporary food establishments is subject to the same
potential for contamination as food served in permanent establishments, the limited
capabilities and short duration of operation are recognized by less stringent
requirements for surface characteristics.
Outdoor Areas	 6-102.11 Surface Characteristics.
The requirements concerning surface characteristics of outdoor areas are intended to
facilitate maintenance and minimize the accumulation of dust and mud on walking and
driving areas, provide durable exterior building surfaces, and prevent the attracting,
harboring, or breeding of insects, rodents, and other pests where refuse, recyclables, or
returnables are stored.
Cleanability	 6-201.11 Floors, Walls, and Ceilings.
6-201.12 Floors, Walls, and Ceilings, Utility Lines.
Floors that are of smooth, durable construction and that are nonabsorbent are more
easily cleaned. Requirements and restrictions regarding floor coverings, utility lines,
and floor/wall junctures are intended to ensure that regular and effective cleaning is
possible and that insect and rodent harborage is minimized.
6-201.13	 Floor and Wall Junctures, Coved, and
Enclosed or Sealed.
When cleaning is accomplished by spraying or flushing, coving and sealing of the
floor/wall junctures is required to provide a surface that is conducive to water flushing.
Grading of the floor to drain allows liquid wastes to be quickly carried away, thereby
preventing pooling which could attract pests such as insects and rodents or contribute
to problems with certain pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes.
6-201.14	 Floor Carpeting, Restrictions and Installation.
Requirements and restrictions regarding floor carpeting are intended to ensure that
regular and effective cleaning is possible and that insect harborage is minimized. The
restrictions for areas not suited for carpeting materials are designed to ensure
cleanability of surfaces where accumulation of moisture or waste is likely.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
527
 



6-201.15	 Floor Covering, Mats and Duckboards.
Requirements regarding mats and duckboards are intended to ensure that regular and
effective cleaning is possible and that accumulation of dirt and waste is prevented.
6-201.16	 Wall and Ceiling Coverings and Coatings.
6-201.17	 Walls and Ceilings, Attachments.
6-201.18	 Walls and Ceilings, Studs, Joists, and
Rafters.
Walls and ceilings that are of smooth construction, nonabsorbent, and in good repair
can be easily and effectively cleaned. Special requirements related to the attachment
of accessories and exposure of wall and ceiling studs, joists, and rafters are intended to
ensure the cleanability of these surfaces.
Functionality 6-202.11 Light Bulbs, Protective Shielding.
Shielding of light bulbs helps prevent breakage. Light bulbs that are shielded, coated,
or otherwise shatter-resistant are necessary to protect exposed food, clean equipment,
utensils and linens, and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles from glass
fragments should the bulb break.
6-202.12	 Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning System
Vents.
Heating and air conditioning system vents that are not properly designed and located
may be difficult to clean and result in the contamination of food, food preparation
surfaces, equipment, or utensils by dust or other accumulated soil from the exhaust
vents.
6-202.13	 Insect Control Devices, Design and
Installation.
Insect electrocution devices are considered supplemental to good sanitation practices
in meeting the Code requirement for controlling the presence of flies and other insects
in a food establishment.
Improper design of the device and dead insect collection tray could allow dead insect
parts and injured insects to escape, rendering the device itself a source of
contamination.
Exposed food and food-contact surfaces must be protected from contamination by
insects or insect parts. Installation of the device over food preparation areas or in close
proximity to exposed food and/or food-contact surfaces could allow dead insects and/or
insect parts to be impelled by the electric charge, fall, or be blown from the device onto
food or food-contact surfaces.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
528
 










6-202.14 Toilet Rooms, Enclosed.
Completely enclosed toilet facilities minimize the potential for the spread of disease by
the movement of flies and other insects between the toilet facility and food preparation
areas.
6-202.15 Outer Openings, Protected.
Insects and rodents are vectors of disease-causing microorganisms which may be
transmitted to humans by contamination of food and food-contact surfaces. The
presence of insects and rodents is minimized by protecting outer openings to the food
establishment.
In the National Fire Protection Association’s NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, 2009 Edition,
doors to exit enclosures such as stairs, horizontal exits, or exit passageways are
required to be self closing. The Life Safety Code does not require exterior doors used
as exits to be self closing, but they can be.
The intent of subparagraph 6-202.15(A)(3) is to protect food establishments from the
entry of insects and rodents by keeping doors closed when not in use. Self-closing
devices allow a door to return to its closed position after use. If an exterior door is not
routinely used for entry or exit because its use is restricted by the fire protection
authority for emergency use only, it is not a portal for the entry of pests and does not
need a self-closing device. Doors not requiring a self-closing device include exterior
emergency exit doors that open into a public way from a fire and that meet the criteria
in ¶ 6-202.15(C).
6-202.16	 Exterior Walls and Roofs, Protective Barrier.
Walls and roofs provide a barrier to protect the interior and foods from the weather,
windblown dirt and debris, and flying insects.
6-202.17	 Outdoor Food Vending Areas, Overhead
Protection.
The potential for contamination from airborne dust and particulates or inclement
weather is present in outside areas. Overhead protection minimizes the potential for
contamination of food under such conditions.
6-202.18	 Outdoor Servicing Areas, Overhead
Protection.
Pooled water, which may result if overhead protection is not provided for outdoor
servicing areas, attracts wild animals and birds and creates a condition suitable for the
breeding of insects.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
529
 







6-202.19	 Outdoor Walking and Driving Surfaces,
Graded to Drain.
If foot traffic is allowed to occur from undrained areas, contamination will be tracked into
the establishment. Surfaces graded to drain minimize these conditions. Pooled water
on exterior walking and driving surfaces may also attract rodents and breed insects.
6-202.110	 Outdoor Refuse Areas, Curbed and Graded to
Drain.
If refuse areas are not graded properly, waste water will pool and attract insects and
rodents.
6-202.111	 Private Homes and Living or Sleeping
Quarters, Use Prohibited.
6-202.112	 Living or Sleeping Quarters, Separation.
Areas or facilities that are not compatible with sanitary food establishment operations
must be located or separated from other areas of the establishment to preclude
potential contamination of food and food-contact surfaces from poisonous or toxic
materials, dust or debris, the presence of improperly designed facilities and equipment,
and the traffic of unauthorized and/or unnecessary persons or pets.
Further, Article IV of the Amendments to the U.S. Constitution ensures the right of
persons to be secure in their homes against unreasonable search and seizure. This
provision could hinder the regulatory authority's access to conduct routine inspections
of a food establishment operated in the living area of a private home. A search warrant
may be the only mechanism by which to gain entry; yet, it may be difficult to obtain and
might not authorize the necessary inspectional activities.
Handwashing
Sinks
6-301.10 Minimum Number.
Refer to the public health reason for § 5-203.11.
6-301.11	 Handwashing Cleanser, Availability.
Hand cleanser must always be present to aid in reducing microorganisms and
particulate matter found on hands.
6-301.12 Hand Drying Provision.
Provisions must be provided for hand drying so that employees will not dry their hands
on their clothing or other unclean materials.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
530
 







It is known that wet hands transfer bacteria more readily than dry hands. The residual
moisture found on the hands after washing allows for bacterial and viral transfer to food
or solid surfaces by touch. The method in which hands are dried is a critical factor in
reducing chances of cross-contamination by hands to food and environmental surfaces
(Patrick et al., (1997)).
With regard to the addition of air knife technology for hand drying, data reviewed by
FDA scientists at the FDA’s National Center for Food Safety Technology (Moffitt
Center) demonstrates that the use of this technology in hand dryers has been found to
be equivalent to the hand drying treatment in existing heated-air devices.
While the Food Code does not specifically address the configuration or ergonomic
design of hand drying devices, technologies employing air knife systems do not appear
to accommodate the drying of one’s arms and may not be large enough to
accommodate surrogate prosthetic devices for hands and arms to fit within the handdryer. In the case where food employees are expected to wash their forearms or are
fitted with a surrogate prosthetic device, the food establishment would need to provide
an alternate means for drying of the arms and certain prosthetic devices.
6-301.14 Handwashing Signage.
A sign or poster is required to remind food employees to wash their hands.
6-301.20 Disposable Towels, Waste Receptacle.
Waste receptacles at handwashing sinks are required for the collection of disposable
towels so that the paper waste will be contained, will not contact food directly or
indirectly, and will not become an attractant for insects or rodents.
Toilets and
Urinals
6-302.10 Minimum Number.
Refer to the public health reason for § 5-203.12.
6-302.11 Toilet Tissue, Availability.
To minimize hand contact with fecal waste, toilet tissue is necessary for hygienic
cleaning following use of toilet facilities. Toilet tissue must be supplied to meet the
demand.
Lighting 6-303.11 Intensity.
Lighting levels are specified so that sufficient light is available to enable employees to
perform certain functions such as reading labels; discerning the color of substances;
identifying toxic materials; recognizing the condition of food, utensils, and supplies; and
safely conducting general food establishment operations and clean-up.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
531
 






Properly distributed light makes the need for cleaning apparent by making
accumulations of soil conspicuous.
Ventilation 6-304.11 Mechanical.
When mechanical ventilation is necessary, it must have adequate capacity to ensure
that soiling of walls, ceilings, and other equipment is minimized; obnoxious odors or
toxic fumes are effectively removed; and no hazards or nuisances involving
accumulation of fats, oils, and similar wastes are created.
Balancing of the exhaust and make-up air must be ensured so that the system can
operate efficiently.
Dressing Areas
and Lockers
6-305.11 Designation.
Street clothing and personal belongings can contaminate food, food equipment, and
food-contact surfaces. Proper storage facilities are required for articles such as purses,
coats, shoes, and personal medications.
Service Sinks 6-306.10 Availability.
A service sink or curbed facility is required so that the cleanliness of the food
establishment can be maintained, attractants for insects and rodents minimized, and
contamination of food and equipment by accumulated soil prevented. Liquid wastes
generated during cleaning must be disposed of in a sanitary manner to preclude
contamination of food and food equipment. A service sink is provided to prevent the
improper disposal of wastes into other sinks such as food preparation and handwashing
sinks.
Handwashing
Sinks
6-401.10 Conveniently Located.
Facilities must be located in or adjacent to toilet rooms and convenient to the different
work stations of the food employee for proper and routine handwashing to prevent
contamination of the food and food-contact surfaces.
Toilet Rooms 6-402.11 Convenience and Accessibility.
Toilet rooms must be conveniently accessible to food employees at all times to
encourage employee use of appropriate facilities for the disposing of human wastes as
needed followed by the washing of hands.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
532
 






Employee
Accommodations
6-403.11 Designated Areas.
Because employees could introduce pathogens to food by hand-to-mouth-to-food
contact and because street clothing and personal belongings carry contaminants, areas
designated to accommodate employees' personal needs must be carefully located.
Food, food equipment and utensils, clean linens, and single-service and single-use
articles must not be in jeopardy of contamination from these areas.
Distressed
Merchandise
6-404.11 Segregation and Location.
Products which are damaged, spoiled, or otherwise unfit for sale or use in a food
establishment may become mistaken for safe and wholesome products and/or cause
contamination of other foods, equipment, utensils, linens, or single-service or single-use
articles. To preclude this, separate and segregated areas must be designated for
storing unsalable goods.
Refuse,
Recyclables,
and Returnables
6-405.10 Receptacles, Waste Handling Units, and
Designated Storage Areas.
Waste materials and empty product containers are unclean and can be an attractant to
insects and rodents. Food, equipment, utensils, linens, and single-service and singleuse articles must be protected from exposure to filth and unclean conditions and other
contaminants. This Code provision addresses these concerns by requiring the facility to
be segregated, to be located to allow cleaning of adjacent areas, and to preclude
creation of a nuisance.

6-501.11 Repairing.

Poor repair and maintenance compromises the functionality of the physical facilities.
This requirement is intended to ensure that the physical facilities are properly
maintained in order to serve their intended purpose.
6-501.12 Cleaning, Frequency and Restrictions.
Cleaning of the physical facilities is an important measure in ensuring the protection
and sanitary preparation of food. A regular cleaning schedule should be established
and followed to maintain the facility in a clean and sanitary manner. Primary cleaning
should be done at times when foods are in protected storage and when food is not
being served or prepared.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
533
 





6-501.13	 Cleaning Floors, Dustless Methods.
Dustless floor cleaning methods must be used so that food; equipment, utensils, and
linens; and single-service and single-use articles are not contaminated.
6-501.14	 Cleaning Ventilation Systems, Nuisance and
Discharge Prohibition.
Both intake and exhaust ducts can be a source of contamination and must be cleaned
regularly. Filters that collect particulate matter must be cleaned or changed frequently
to prevent overloading of the filter. Outside areas under or adjacent to exhaust duct
outlets at the exterior of the building must be maintained in a clean and sanitary manner
to prevent pest attraction.
6-501.15	 Cleaning Maintenance Tools, Preventing
Contamination.
Maintenance tools used to repair the physical facilities must be cleaned in a separate
area to prevent contamination of food and food preparation and warewashing areas.
6-501.16	 Drying Mops.
Mops can contaminate food and food preparation areas if not properly cleaned and
stored after use. Mops should be cleaned and dried in a sanitary manner away from
food flow areas.
6-501.17	 Absorbent Materials on Floors, Use
Limitation.
Cleanliness of the food establishment is important to minimize attractants for insects
and rodents, aid in preventing the contamination of food and equipment, and prevent
nuisance conditions. A clean and orderly food establishment is also conducive to
positive employee attitudes which can lead to increased attention to personal hygiene
and improved food preparation practices. Use of specified cleaning procedures is
important in precluding avoidable contamination of food and equipment and nuisance
conditions.
Temporary floor coverings such as sawdust can contaminate food, attract insects and
rodents, and become a nuisance to the food operation.
6-501.18 Cleaning of Plumbing Fixtures.
Handwashing facilities are critical to food protection and must be maintained in
operating order at all times so they will be used.
Refer also to the public health reason for § 5-205.11.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
534
 


Toilet facilities must be of sanitary design and kept clean and in good repair to prevent
food contamination and to motivate employees to use sanitary practices in the
establishment.
Hand contact with contaminated surfaces can result in self-inoculation by touching of
the nose and mouth. The spread of Shigella sonnei in a nursery school has been
traced to contaminated toilets. Experiments by Gerba, et al and Barker and Bloomfield
have shown that when bacteria and viruses were seeded into a household toilet, the
detection of bacteria and viruses in the fallout droplets from the aerosols produced
when flushing remain airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the
bathroom. Barker and Bloomfield also demonstrated that Salmonella Enteritidis could
be isolated from the air surrounding a household toilet after flushing the toilet.
Noroviruses which are a major cause of gastroenteritis can be transmitted by fecal-oral,
airborne inhalation, person-to-person and environmental-to-person routes. Norovirus,
which is highly infectious, is shed in vomitus and stool in high numbers. A study was
conducted by J. Barker et al to look at the transmission of norovirus via fingers, cloths
and contact surfaces. The results indicated that where fingers come into contact with
virus-contaminated toilet tissue, norovirus is consistently transferred via the fingers to a
melamine surface and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces such as taps,
door handles and telephone receivers. In this study epidemiological evidence suggests
that environmental spread from an infective person occurs by settling of aerosol
particles on to contact surfaces. Hands can then spread the virus when they touch
toilet seats or flush handles contaminated by splash from vomit or aerosol particles
generated during toilet flushing.
6-501.19 Closing Toilet Room Doors.
Toilet room doors must remain closed except during cleaning operations to prevent
insect and rodent entrance and the associated potential for the spread of disease.
6-501.110 Using Dressing Rooms and Lockers.
Street clothing and personal belongings can contaminate food, food equipment, and
food preparation surfaces and consequently must be stored in properly designated
areas or rooms.
6-501.111 Controlling Pests.
Insects and other pests are capable of transmitting disease to humans by
contaminating food and food-contact surfaces. Effective measures must be taken to
eliminate their presence in food establishments.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
535
 







6-501.112	 Removing Dead or Trapped Birds, Insects,
Rodents, and Other Pests.
Dead rodents, birds, and insects must be removed promptly from the facilities to ensure
clean and sanitary facilities and to preclude exacerbating the situation by allowing
carcasses to attract other pests.
6-501.113 Storing Maintenance Tools.
Brooms, mops, vacuum cleaners, and other maintenance equipment can contribute
contamination to food and food-contact surfaces. These items must be stored in a
manner that precludes such contamination.
To prevent harborage and breeding conditions for rodents and insects, maintenance
equipment must be stored in an orderly fashion to permit cleaning of the area.
6-501.114	 Maintaining Premises, Unnecessary Items
and Litter.
The presence of unnecessary articles, including equipment which is no longer used,
makes regular and effective cleaning more difficult and less likely. It can also provide
harborage for insects and rodents.
Areas designated as equipment storage areas and closets must be maintained in a
neat, clean, and sanitary manner. They must be routinely cleaned to avoid attractive or
harborage conditions for rodents and insects.
6-501.115 Prohibiting Animals.
Animals carry disease-causing organisms and can transmit pathogens to humans
through direct and/or indirect contamination of food and food-contact surfaces. The
restrictions apply to live animals with limited access allowed only in specific situations
and under controlled conditions and to the storage of live and dead fish bait.
Employees with service animals are required under § 2-301.14 to wash their hands
after each contact with animals to remove bacteria and soil.
Animals shed hair continuously and may deposit liquid or fecal waste, creating the need
for vigilance and more frequent and rigorous cleaning efforts.
The definition for "service animal" is adapted from 28 CFR 36.104 adopted pursuant to
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). A service
animal performs some of the functions that persons with a disability cannot perform for
themselves, such as those provided by "seeing eye dogs"; alerting persons with hearing
impairments to sounds; pulling wheelchairs or carrying and picking up things for
persons with mobility impairments; and assisting persons with mobility impairments with
balance. A service animal is not considered to be a pet.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
536
 







Under Title III of the ADA, privately owned businesses that serve the public are
prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. The ADA requires
these businesses to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto
business premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed. Some, but not
all, service animals wear special collars or harnesses. Some, but not all, are licensed
or certified and have identification papers.
Decisions regarding a food employee or applicant with a disability who needs to use a
service animal should be made on a case-by-case basis. An employer must comply
with health and safety requirements, but is obligated to consider whether there is a
reasonable accommodation that can be made. Guidance is available from the U.S.
Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Disability Rights Section or the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal agency which has the lead in these
matters, in documents such as, “Commonly Asked Questions About Service Animals in
Places of Business”; “The Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers”; “A
Guide to Disability Rights Laws”; and “Americans with Disabilities Act Title III Technical
Assistance Manual, 1994 Supplement.” The ADA Information Line is 800-514-0301

Chapter 7 Poisonous or Toxic Materials
Original
Containers
7-101.11 Identifying Information, Prominence.
The accidental contamination of food or food-contact surfaces can cause serious
illness. Prominent and distinct labeling helps ensure that poisonous and toxic materials
including personal care items are properly used.
Working
Containers
7-102.11 Common Name.
It is common practice in food establishments to purchase many poisonous or toxic
materials including cleaners and sanitizers in bulk containers. Working containers are
frequently used to convey these materials to areas where they will be used, resulting in
working containers being stored in different locations in the establishment.
Identification of these containers with the common name of the material helps prevent
the dangerous misuse of the contents.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
537
 






Storage 7-201.11 Separation.
Separation of poisonous and toxic materials in accordance with the requirements of this
section ensures that food, equipment, utensils, linens, and single-service and singleuse articles are properly protected from contamination. For example, the storage of
these types of materials directly above or adjacent to food could result in contamination
of the food from spillage.
Presence
and Use
7-202.11 Restriction.
The presence in the establishment of poisonous or toxic materials that are not required
for the maintenance and operation of the establishment represents an unnecessary risk
to both employees and consumers.
Preserving food safety depends in part on the appropriate and proper storage and use
of poisonous or toxic materials that are necessary to the maintenance and operation of
a food establishment. Even those that are necessary can pose a hazard if they are
used in a manner that contradicts the intended use of the material as described by the
manufacturer on the material's label. If additional poisonous or toxic materials are
present, there is an unwarranted increased potential for contamination due to improper
storage (e.g., overhead spillage that could result in the contamination of food, foodcontact surfaces, or food equipment) or inappropriate application.
7-202.12 Conditions of Use.
Failure to properly use poisonous or toxic materials can be dangerous. Many
poisonous or toxic materials have general use directions on their label. Failure to follow
the stated instructions could result in injury to employees and consumers through direct
contact or the contamination of food.
Particular precautions must be taken during the application of poisonous or toxic
materials to prevent the contamination of food and other food-contact surfaces.
Residues of certain materials are not discernible to the naked eye and present an
additional risk to the employee and consumer.
Because of the toxicity of restricted use pesticides, they can only be applied by certified
operators. A certified operator would be aware of the dangers involved in the
contamination of food and food-contact surfaces during the application of these
materials. Improperly applied pesticides present health risks to employees as well as
consumers and special precautions must be taken when restricted use pesticides are
applied.

Container
Prohibitions
7-203.11 Poisonous or Toxic Material Containers.
Use of poisonous or toxic material containers to store, transport, or dispense food is
prohibited because of the potential for contamination of the food. The risk of serious
medical consequences to anyone consuming food stored in these containers coupled
with the lack of confidence that all of the material could or would be removed in the
wash and sanitizing procedures are reasons for prohibiting this practice.
Chemicals 7-204.11 Sanitizers, Criteria.
See explanation in §4-501.114.
Chemical sanitizers are included with poisonous or toxic materials because they may
be toxic if not used in accordance with requirements listed in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR). Large concentrations of sanitizer in excess of the CFR
requirements can be harmful because residues of the materials remain. The CFR
reference that is provided lists concentrations of sanitizers that are considered safe.
Section 7-204.11 addresses whether or not the chemical agent being applied as a
sanitizer is approved and listed for that use under 40 CFR 180.940, Tolerance
exemptions for active and inert ingredients for use in antimicrobial formulations (food
contact sanitizing solutions) or 40 CFR 180.2020, Non-food determinations. Because
there is no EPA registration of solutions generated and used on-site, the user of the
equipment should look to the equipment manufacturer for data to validate the efficacy
of the solution that is generated by the device as well as the conditions for use of the
solution.
Some sanitizers produced by on-site generators are based on gases dissolved in
solution. These may present toxicology issues if the gases can come out of solution
and into the air at high concentrations. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) limits on gases like ozone and chlorine dioxide are outlined in 29 CFR
1910.1000, Air contaminants. Although the amount of dissolved gas in solution may be
very low when evenly distributed through out all the air in a site, the gas may not be
evenly distributed. This may lead to localized concentrations, e.g., immediately over a
three compartment sink, that exceed OSHA limits. It is the responsibility of the permit
holder and equipment supplier to ensure that the equipment is used in a safe manner
so that OSHA limits will not be exceeded anywhere in the permit holder's facility.

7-204.12 Chemicals for Washing Fruits and
Vegetables, Criteria.
7-204.13 Boiler Water Additives, Criteria.
7-204.14 Drying Agents, Criteria.
If the chemical wash, boiler water additive, or drying agent used is not made up of
components that are approved as food additives or generally recognized as safe, illness
may result. This could be due to residues that may remain from the use of compounds
such as unrecognized drying agents. This is why only those chemicals that are
approved food additives or food-contact substances, generally recognized as safe, prior
sanctioned or exempted by the threshold of regulation process can be used.
Information regarding food contact substances notification may be found on the FDA
website under the Food Topic in Ingredients and Packaging section at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/default.htm
Chemicals that are not generally recognized as safe, or not authorized by FDA for these
uses may be submitted for review by filing a Food Additive Petition, a Food Contact
Notification (FCN), or a request for exemption under the Threshold of Regulation.
Wash chemicals, boiler water additives, and drying agents are classified as food
additives because of the possibility that they may end up in food. Therefore, they are
subject to review before being used or listed in the CFR. If the chemicals are hard
food-contact sanitizers, or washes for raw agricultural commodities (RACs) that are
used on a farm or in a packing house, then this is under the jurisdiction of the EPA.
21 CFR 173 Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human
Consumption includes a number of regulations permitting certain food additives to be
used for washing fruits and vegetables. In an effort to be consistent with federal law a
change was made in Section 7-204.12 Chemicals for Washing, Treatment, Storage and
Processing Fruits and Vegetables, Criteria to include all of 21 CFR 173 so as not to
exclude the use of other permitted food additives. There is also another mechanism for
approval of antimicrobial agents for washing fruits and vegetables (i.e., the food contact
notification program) as well as GRAS ingredients permitted as antimicrobials or for
general food use. This revision allows for the use of ingredients that are GRAS for this
use and food contact substances which were the subject of an effective food contact
notification for this use. 21 CFR 173 includes permitted food additives such as those
listed in 21 CFR 173.315 Chemicals used in the washing or to assist in the peeling of
fruits and vegetables. This section specifically identifies some of the chemicals that
may be used in washing fruits and vegetables, regardless of whether the chemicals are
commercially produced or generated on site. Sodium hypochlorite is listed in 21 CFR
173.315 for use in washing fruits and vegetables at levels not exceeding the minimum
amount required to accomplish the intended technical effect. FDA has no objection to
the use of calcium hypochlorite in the place of sodium hypochlorite under 21 CFR
173.315.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
540
 









On December 4, 2012, the FDA amended the food additive regulations to provide for
the safe use of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) (CAS No. 25155-30-0) as an
antimicrobial agent for use in wash water for fruits and vegetables without the
requirement of a potable water rinse. 21 CFR Section 173.405 specifically identifies
this additive as an antimicrobial agent used in wash water for fruits and vegetables.
The additive may be used at a level not to exceed 111 milligrams per kilogram in the
wash water. Fruits and vegetables treated by the additive do not require a potable
water rinse. Use of this additive is limited to use in commissaries, cafeterias,
restaurants, retail food establishments, nonprofit food establishments and other food
service operations in which food is prepared for or served directly to the consumer. To
ensure safe use of the additive, refer to the label or labeling of the additive and/or
antimicrobial pesticide container for adequate directions. Information on the label is
required in accordance to provisions within 21 CFR 173.405 and the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act. Although the petitioned use of SDBS is regulated under
Section 409 of the FD & C Act as a food additive, this intended use of SDBS may
nevertheless be subject to regulation as a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). EPA requirements pertain to EPA registered
pesticide products that have uses subject to EPA or both FDA and EPA regulations.
Therefore, manufacturers intending to use this food additive for this intended use
should contact the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether this use
requires a pesticide registration under FIFRA.
Boiler water additives that may be safely used in the preparation of steam that may
contact food, and their condition of use, are identified in 21 CFR 173.310 Boiler Water
Additives.
Lubricants	 7-205.11 Incidental Food Contact, Criteria.
Lubricants used on food equipment may directly or indirectly end up in the food.
Therefore, the lubricants used must be approved as food additives or generally
recognized as safe and listed in the CFR. Lubricants that are not safe present the
possibility of foodborne illness if they find their way into the food.
Pesticides	 7-206.11 Restricted Use Pesticides, Criteria.
7-206.12 Rodent Bait Stations.
Open bait stations may result in the spillage of the poison being used. Also, it is easier
for pests to transport the potentially toxic bait throughout the establishment.
Consequently, the bait may end up on food-contact surfaces and ultimately in the food
being prepared or served.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
541
 





7-206.13 Tracking Powders, Pest Control and
Monitoring.
The use of tracking powder pesticides presents the potential for the powder to be
dispersed throughout the establishment. Consequently, the powder could directly or
indirectly contaminate food being prepared. This contamination could adversely affect
both the safety and quality of the food and, therefore, tracking powder pesticides are
not allowed.
Medicines 7-207.11 Restriction and Storage.
Medicines that are not necessary for the health of employees present an unjustified risk
to the health of other employees and consumers due to misuse and/or improper
storage.
There are circumstances that require employees or children in a day care center to
have personal medications on hand in the establishment. To prevent misuse, personal
medications must be labeled and stored in accordance with the requirements stated for
poisonous or toxic materials. Proper labeling and storage of medicines to ensure that
they are not accidentally misused or otherwise contaminate food or food-contact
surfaces.
7-207.12 Refrigerated Medicines, Storage.
Some employee medications may require refrigerated storage. If employee
medications are stored in a food refrigerator, precautions must be taken to prevent the
contamination of other items stored in the same refrigerator.
First Aid
Supplies
7-208.11 Storage.
First aid supplies for employee use must be identified and stored in accordance with the
requirements of this Code in order to preclude the accidental contamination of food,
food equipment, and other food-contact surfaces.
Other Personal
Care Items
7-209.11 Storage.
Employee personal care items may serve as a source of contamination and may
contaminate food, food equipment, and food-contact surfaces if they are not properly
labeled and stored.
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
542
 







Storage and
Display
7-301.11 Separation.
Poisonous or toxic materials held for sale on store shelves or stored in stock rooms
present a risk of contamination of food, equipment, utensils, linens, and single-service
and single-use articles if not stored properly.

8-201.12 Contents of the Plans and Specifications.
8-203.10 Preoperational Inspections.
In conjunction with the Conference for Food Protection Plan Review committee, FDA
has participated in developing a document that is intended to assist regulators in
reviewing food establishment plans, and industry in understanding what is expected in
the plan review process. For several years, this FDA/CFP Food Establishment Plan
Review Guide – 2000 has been used in the FDA State Training Team Plan Review
courses. It can be accessed through
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulat
oryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm101639.htm.
At the plan review stage, the regulatory authority may be dealing with an agent of the
permit applicant who is seeking a building permit and who is not in a position to discuss
plans for safely conducting the food operation. Nonetheless, the plan review step
presents a unique opportunity to lay a foundation that enables the proposed operation
to proactively sustain compliance with the Code over time. Standard operating
procedures (SOPs) are a part of that foundation and ideally are developed in tandem
with designing the facility. Consequently, as an integral part of the plan review process,
discussion needs to occur about such procedures and their scope.
SOPs need to be developed by the time of the preoperational inspection and put into
effect when the food operation begins. It is recommended that such procedures be
written, available for reference by the person in charge, conveyed to the appropriate
employees, and available for review by the regulatory authority during inspections.
Operating procedures should include definitive practices and expectations that ensure
that:
(1) The transmission of foodborne disease is prevented by managing job applicants and
food employees as specified under Subpart 2-201,
(2) Food is received from approved sources as specified under § 3-201.11,
Annex 3 – Public Health Reasons/Administrative Guidelines
543
 






(3) Food is managed so that the safety and integrity of the food from the time of delivery
to the establishment throughout its storage, preparation, and transportation to the point
of sale or service to the consumer is protected,
(4) Time/temperature control for safety food is maintained, including freezing, cold
holding, cooking, hot holding, cooling, reheating, and serving in conformance with the
temperature and time requirements specified under Parts 3-4 and 3-5,
(5) Warewashing is effective, including assurance that the chemical solutions and
exposure times necessary for cleaning and sanitizing utensils and food-contact
surfaces of equipment are provided as specified under Parts 4-6 and 4-7, and
(6) Records that are specified under §§ 3-203.11, 3-203.12, and 5-205.13 are retained
for inspection.
During the plan review stage, the regulatory authority and a management
representative of the proposed food establishment should discuss available training
options that may be used to train food employees and the person in charge regarding
food safety as it relates to their assigned duties. By the time of the preoperational
inspection, operating procedures for training should include definitive practices and
expectations of how the management of the proposed food establishment plans to
comply with ¶ 2-103.11(L) of this Code which requires the person in charge to assure
that food employees are properly trained in food safety as it relates to their assigned
duties.
8-304.11 Responsibility of the Permit Holder
It is important that regulatory agencies comply with applicable laws related to disclosure
of public information. Making inspection reports available to the public promotes
transparency and allows the public to be better informed about the businesses they
patronize and the government agencies that serve the public. The intent is to improve
industry and regulatory practices related to food safety at the foodservice and retail
level.
8-402.10 Competency of Inspectors.
Regulatory agencies are encouraged to use Standard #2 of the draft FDA’s
Recommended National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards
/default.htm) to ensure employees who inspect food establishments are properly
trained. Regulatory inspectors are also encouraged to seek food safety certification
through a nationally recognized and accredited program.

1.	 ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL
(A)	 What is the common goal of operators and regulators of retail food and food
service establishments and what is presently being done to achieve this
goal?
The common goal of operators and regulators of retail and food service establishments
is to produce safe, quality food for consumers. Since the onset of regulatory oversight
of retail and food service operations, regulatory inspections have emphasized the
recognition and correction of food safety violations that exist at the time of the
inspection. Recurring violations have traditionally been handled through re-inspections
or enforcement activities such as fines, suspension of permits, or closures. Operators of
retail and food service establishments routinely respond to inspection findings by
correcting violations, but often do not implement proactive systems of control to prevent
violations from recurring. While this type of inspection and enforcement system has
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
547
 







done a great deal to improve basic sanitation and to upgrade facilities in the United
States, it emphasizes reactive rather than preventive measures to food safety.
Additional measures must be taken on the part of operators and regulators to better
prevent or reduce foodborne illness. Annex 5 of the Food Code provides additional
information on conducting risk-based inspections. It should be reviewed in conjunction
with the material found in this Annex to better understand the role of the regulator in
facilitating active managerial control by the operator.
(B) Who has the ultimate responsibility for providing safe food to the consumer?
The responsibility of providing safe food to the consumer is shared by many people in
every stage in the production of food, including consumers, themselves. Since most
consumers receive their food from retail and food service establishments, a significant
share of the responsibility for providing safe food to the consumer rests with these
facilities. Working together with their regulatory authorities, operators of retail and food
service establishments can make the greatest impact on food safety.
(C) How can foodborne illness be reduced?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Report for 1993­
1997, “Surveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks – United States,” identifies the
most significant contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these broad
categories of contributing factors directly relate to food safety concerns within retail and
food service establishments and are collectively termed by the FDA as “foodborne
illness risk factors.” These five broad categories are:
• Food from Unsafe Sources
• Inadequate Cooking
• Improper Holding Temperatures
• Contaminated Equipment
• Poor Personal Hygiene.
In 1998, FDA initiated a project designed to determine the incidence of foodborne
illness risk factors in retail and food service establishments. Inspections focusing on
the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors were conducted in establishments
throughout the United States. The results of this project are published in the 2000
Report of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors,
commonly referred to as the “FDA Baseline Report.” The Baseline Report is available
from FDA through the following website:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM123546.pdf. The data
collection project was repeated in 2003 and the results are published in the FDA Report
on the Occurrence of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Selected Institutional
Foodservice, Restaurant, and Retail Food Store Facility Types (2004). This second
report is available from FDA through the following website:
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
548
 







http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodborneIllnessRi
skFactorReduction/ucm089696.htm.
The data collection was repeated again in 2008 and published in a 2009 report This
was followed by a Trend Analysis Report covering 1998-2008 that was published in
October 2010. The CDC Surveillance Report and the results from the FDA Risk Factor
Studies support the concept that operators of retail and food service establishments
must be proactive and implement food safety management systems that will prevent,
eliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. By reducing the
occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, foodborne illness can also be reduced.
(D) How can the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors be reduced?
To effectively reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, operators of retail
and food service establishments must focus their efforts on achieving active managerial
control. The term “active managerial control” is used to describe industry’s
responsibility for developing and implementing food safety management systems to
prevent, eliminate, or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.
Active managerial control means the purposeful incorporation of specific actions or
procedures by industry management into the operation of their business to attain
control over foodborne illness risk factors. It embodies a preventive rather than reactive
approach to food safety through a continuous system of monitoring and verification.
There are many tools that can be used by industry to provide active managerial control
of foodborne illness risk factors. Regulatory inspections and follow-up activities must
also be proactive by using an inspection process designed to assess the degree of
active managerial control that retail and food service operators have over the foodborne
illness risk factors. In addition, regulators must assist operators in developing and
implementing voluntary strategies to strengthen existing industry systems to prevent the
occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors. Elements of an effective food safety
management system may include the following:
•	 Certified food protection managers who have shown a proficiency in required
information by passing a test that is part of an accredited program
•	 Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for performing critical operational steps
in a food preparation process, such as cooling
•	 Recipe cards that contain the specific steps for preparing a food item and the
food safety critical limits, such as final cooking temperatures, that need to be
monitored and verified
•	 Purchase specifications
•	 Equipment and facility design and maintenance
•	 Monitoring procedures
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
549
 







•	 Record keeping
•	 Employee health policy for restricting or excluding ill employees
•	 Manager and employee training
•	 On-going quality control and assurance
•	 Specific goal-oriented plans, like Risk Control Plans (RCPs), that outline
procedures for controlling foodborne illness risk factors.

A food safety management system based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point
(HACCP) principles contains many of these elements and provides a comprehensive
framework by which an operator can effectively control the occurrence of foodborne
illness risk factors.
2.	 INTRODUCTION TO HACCP
(A) What is HACCP and how can it be used by operators and regulators of retail
food and food service establishments?
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic approach to
identifying, evaluating, and controlling food safety hazards. Food safety hazards are
biological, chemical, or physical agents that are reasonably likely to cause illness or
injury in the absence of their control. Because a HACCP program is designed to
ensure that hazards are prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level before
a food reaches the consumer, it embodies the preventive nature of “active managerial
control.”
Active managerial control through the use of HACCP principles is achieved by
identifying the food safety hazards attributed to products, determining the necessary
steps that will control the identified hazards, and implementing on-going practices or
procedures that will ensure safe food.
Like many other quality assurance programs, HACCP provides a common-sense
approach to identifying and controlling problems that are likely to exist in an operation.
Consequently, many food safety management systems at the retail level already
incorporate some, if not all, of the principles of HACCP. Combined with good basic
sanitation, a solid employee training program, and other prerequisite programs, a food
safety management system based on HACCP principles will prevent, eliminate, or
reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors that lead to out-of-control
hazards.
HACCP represents an important tool in food protection that small independent
businesses as well as national companies can use to achieve active managerial control
of risk factors. The Food Code requires a comprehensive HACCP plan when
conducting certain specialized processes at retail such as when a variance is granted or
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
550
 







when a reduced oxygen packaging method is used. However, in general, the
implementation of HACCP at the retail level is voluntary. FDA endorses the voluntary
implementation of food safety management systems based on HACCP principles as an
effective means for controlling the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors that
result in out-of-control hazards.
While the operator is responsible for developing and implementing a system of controls
to prevent foodborne illness risk factors, the role of the regulator is to assess whether
the system the operator has in place is achieving control of foodborne illness risk
factors. Using HACCP principles during inspections will enhance the effectiveness of
routine inspections by incorporating a risk-based approach. This helps inspectors focus
their inspection on evaluating the effectiveness of food safety management systems
implemented by industry to control foodborne illness risk factors.
The principles of HACCP are also an integral part of the draft FDA’s Recommended
Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. For regulatory program
managers, the use of risk-based inspection methodology based on HACCP principles is
a viable and practical option for evaluating the degree of active managerial control
operators have over the foodborne illness risk factors. The complete set of Program
Standards is available from FDA through the following website:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/
default.htm.
(B) What are the Seven HACCP Principles?
In November 1992, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for
Foods (NACMCF) defined seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explained the
HACCP process in great detail. In 1997, NACMCF reconvened to review the 1992
document and compare it to current HACCP guidance prepared by the CODEX
Committee on Food Hygiene. Based on this review, NACMCF again endorsed HACCP
and defined HACCP as a systematic approach to the identification, evaluation, and
control of food safety. Based on a solid foundation of prerequisite programs to control
basic operational and sanitation conditions, the following seven basic principles are
used to accomplish this objective:
Principle 1: Conduct a hazard analysis
Principle 2: Determine the critical control points (CCPs)
Principle 3: Establish critical limits
Principle 4: Establish monitoring procedures
Principle 5: Establish corrective actions
Principle 6: Establish verification procedures
Principle 7: Establish record-keeping and documentation procedures.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
551
 






This Annex will provide a brief overview of each of the seven principles of HACCP. A
more comprehensive discussion of these principles is available from FDA by accessing
the NACMCF guidance document on the FDA Web Page at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformati
on/Juice/ucm072557.htm. Following the overview, a practical scheme for applying and
implementing the HACCP principles in retail and food service establishments is
presented.
(C) What are Prerequisite Programs?
In order for a HACCP system to be effective, a strong foundation of procedures that
address the basic operational and sanitation conditions within an operation must first be
developed and implemented. These procedures are collectively termed “prerequisite
programs.” When prerequisite programs are in place, more attention can be given to
controlling hazards associated with the food and its preparation. Prerequisite programs
may include such things as:
•	 Vendor certification programs
•	 Training programs
•	 Allergen management
•	 Buyer specifications
•	 Recipe/process instructions
•	 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) procedures
•	 Other Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
Basic prerequisite programs should be in place to:
•	 Protect products from contamination by biological, chemical, and physical food
safety hazards
•	 Control bacterial growth that can result from temperature abuse
•	 Maintain equipment.
Additional information about prerequisite programs and the types of activities usually
included in them can be found in the FDA’s Retail HACCP manuals discussed later in
this Annex or by accessing the NACMCF guidance document on the FDA Web Page.

3. THE HACCP PRINCIPLES
(A) Principle #1: Conduct a Hazard Analysis
(1) What is a food safety hazard?
A hazard is a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be
unsafe for human consumption.
(2) What are biological hazards?
Biological hazards include bacterial, viral, and parasitic microorganisms. See Table 1 in
this Annex for a listing of selected biological hazards. Bacterial pathogens comprise the
majority of confirmed foodborne disease outbreaks and cases. Although cooking
destroys the vegetative cells of foodborne bacteria to acceptable levels, spores of
spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium
perfringens survive cooking and may germinate and grow if food is not properly cooled
or held after cooking. The toxins produced by the vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus,
Clostridium botulinum, and Staphylococcus aureus may not be destroyed to safe levels
by reheating. Post-cook recontamination with vegetative cells of bacteria such as
Salmonellae and Campylobacter jejuni is also a major concern for operators of retail
and food service establishments.
Viruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A, and rotavirus are directly related to
contamination from human feces. Recent outbreaks have also shown that these
viruses may be transmitted via droplets in the air. In limited cases, foodborne viruses
may occur in raw commodities contaminated by human feces (e.g., shellfish harvested
from unapproved, polluted waters). In most cases, however, contamination of food by
viruses is the result of cross-contamination by ill food employees or unclean equipment
and utensils. Unlike bacteria, a virus cannot multiply outside of a living cell. Cooking as
a control for viruses may be ineffective because many foodborne viruses seem to
exhibit heat resistance exceeding cooking temperature requirements, under laboratory
conditions. Obtaining food from approved sources, practicing no bare hand contact
with ready-to-eat food as well as proper handwashing, and implementing an employee
health policy to restrict or exclude ill employees are important control measures for
viruses.
Parasites are most often animal host-specific, but can include humans in their life
cycles. Parasitic infections are commonly associated with undercooking meat products
or cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food with raw animal foods, untreated water, or
contaminated equipment or utensils. Like viruses, parasites do not grow in food, so
control is focused on destroying the parasites and/or preventing their introduction.
Adequate cooking destroys parasites. In addition, parasites in fish to be consumed raw
or undercooked can also be destroyed by effective freezing techniques. Parasitic

contamination by ill employees can be prevented by proper handwashing, no bare hand
contact with ready-to-eat food, and implementation of an employee health policy to
restrict or exclude ill employees.

(3) What are Chemical Hazards?
Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring or may be added during the processing of
food. High levels of toxic chemicals may cause acute cases of foodborne illness, while
chronic illness may result from low levels.
The Code of Federal Regulations (http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-tablesearch.html), Title 21 Food and Drugs, provides guidance on naturally occurring
poisonous or deleterious substances, e.g., 21 CFR Parts 109 Unavoidable
Contaminants in Food for Human Consumption and Food Packaging Material, and 184
Direct Food Substances Affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe. The CFR also
provide allowable limits for many of the chemicals added during processing, e.g., 21
CFR Part 172 Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food For Human
Consumption.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
556
 











FDA’s Compliance Policy Guidelines also provide information on naturally occurring
chemicals
(http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/defa
ult.htm ). See Chapter 5 – Foods, Colors and Cosmetics. Examples include sections:
•	 540.600 Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans, and Other Aquatic Animals – Fresh,
Frozen or Processed – Methyl Mercury,
•	 555.400 Foods – Adulteration with Aflatoxin, and
•	 570.200 Aflatoxin in Brazil Nuts, .375 Peanuts and Peanut Products, and .500
Pistachio Nuts.
Table 2 of this Annex provides additional examples of chemical hazards, both naturally
occurring and added.
(4) Food Allergens As Food Safety Hazards
Recent studies indicate that over 11 million Americans suffer from one or more food
allergies. A food allergy is caused by a naturally-occurring protein in a food or a food
ingredient, which is referred to as an “allergen.” For unknown reasons, certain
individuals produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specifically directed to food
allergens. When these sensitive individuals ingest sufficient concentrations of foods
containing these allergens, the allergenic proteins interact with IgE antibodies and elicit
an abnormal immune response. A food allergic response is commonly characterized by
hives or other itchy rashes, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and/or diarrhea,
wheezing, shortness of breath, and swelling of various parts of the body. In severe
cases, anaphylactic shock and death may result.
Many foods, with or without identifiable allergens, have been reported to cause food
allergies. However, FDA believes there is scientific consensus that the following foods
can cause a serious allergic reaction in sensitive individuals; these foods account for
90% or more of all food allergies:
• Milk
• Egg
• Fish (such as bass, flounder, or cod)
• Crustacean shellfish (such as crab, lobster, or shrimp)
• Tree nuts (such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts)
• Wheat
• Peanuts
• Soybeans.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
557
 

Consumers with food allergies rely heavily on information contained on food labels to
avoid food allergens. Each year, FDA receives reports from consumers who have
experienced an adverse reaction following exposure to a food allergen. Frequently,
these reactions occur either because product labeling does not inform the consumer of
the presence of the allergenic ingredient in the food or because of the cross-contact of
a food with an allergenic substance not intended as an ingredient of the food during
processing and preparation.
In August 2004, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law
108-282, Title II) was enacted, which defines the term “major food allergen.” The
definition of “major food allergen” adopted for use in the Food Code (see paragraph
1-201.10(B)) is consistent with the definition in the new law. The following requirements
are included in the new law:
•	 For foods labeled on or after January 1, 2006, food manufacturers must identify
in plain language on the label of the food any major food allergen used as an
ingredient in the food, including a coloring, flavoring, or incidental additive.
•	 FDA is to conduct inspections to ensure that food facilities comply with practices
to reduce or eliminate cross-contact of a food with any major food allergens that
are not intentional ingredients of the food.
•	 Within 18 months of the date of enactment of the new law (i.e., by February 2,
2006), FDA must submit a report to Congress that analyzes the results of its food
inspection findings and addresses a number of specific issues related to the
production, labeling, and recall of foods that contain an undeclared major food
allergen.
•	 Within 2 years of the date of enactment of the new law (i.e., by August 2, 2006),
FDA must issue a proposed rule, and within 4 years of the date of enactment of
the new law (i.e., by August 2, 2008), FDA must issue a final rule to define and
permit the use of the term “gluten-free” on food labeling.
•	 FDA is to work in cooperation with the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) to
pursue revision of the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergenfree foods in food establishments.

(5) What are Physical Hazards?
Illness and injury can result from foreign objects in food. These physical hazards can
result from contamination or poor procedures at many points in the food chain from
harvest to consumer, including those within the food establishment. As establishments
develop their food safety management systems, Annex 4, Table 3 can be used to aid in
the identification of sources of potential physical hazards to the food being prepared,
served, or sold. Annex 4, Table 3 provides some examples of common physical
hazards.

(6) What is the purpose of the hazard analysis principle?
The purpose of hazard analysis is to develop a list of food safety hazards that are
reasonably likely to cause illness or injury if not effectively controlled.
(7) How is the hazard analysis conducted?
The process of conducting a hazard analysis involves two stages:
1. Hazard Identification
2. Hazard Evaluation
Hazard identification can be thought of as a brain storming session. This stage focuses
on identifying the food safety hazards that might be present in the food given the food
preparation process used, the handling of the food, the facility, and general
characteristics of the food itself. During this stage, a review is made of the ingredients
used in the product, the activities conducted at each step in the process, the equipment
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
563
 







used, the final product, and its method of storage and distribution, as well as the
intended use and consumers of the product.

Based on this review, a list of potential biological, chemical, or physical hazards is

made at each stage in the food preparation process.

In stage two, the hazard evaluation, each potential hazard is evaluated based on the
severity of the potential hazard and its likely occurrence. The purpose of this stage is to
determine which of the potential hazards listed in stage one of the hazard analysis

warrant control in the HACCP plan. Severity is the seriousness of the consequences of

exposure to the hazard. Considerations made when determining the severity of a
hazard include understanding the impact of the medical condition caused by the illness,

as well as the magnitude and duration of the illness or injury. Consideration of the likely

occurrence is usually based upon a combination of experience, epidemiological data,

and information in the technical literature. Hazards that are not reasonably likely to
occur are not considered in a HACCP plan. During the evaluation of each potential

hazard, the food, its method of preparation, transportation, storage, and persons likely

to consume the product should be considered to determine how each of these factors

may influence the likely occurrence and severity of the hazard being controlled.

Upon completion of the hazard analysis, a list of significant hazards that must be
considered in the HACCP plan is made, along with any measure(s) that can be used to
control the hazards. These measures, called control measures, are actions or activities

that can be used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a hazard. Some control measures are
not essential to food safety, while others are. Control measures essential to food safety

like proper cooking, cooling, and refrigeration of ready-to-eat, time/temperature control

for safety foods are usually applied at critical control points (CCPs) in the HACCP plan
(discussed later). The term control measure is used because not all hazards can be
prevented, but virtually all can be controlled. More than one control measure may be
required for a specific hazard. Likewise, more than one hazard may be addressed by a
specific control measure (e.g., proper cooking).

(B) Principle #2: Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)
(1) What is the Critical Control Point (CCP)?
A critical control point (CCP) means a point or procedure in a specific food system
where loss of control may result in an unacceptable health risk. Control can be applied
at this point and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to
an acceptable level. Each CCP will have one or more control measures to assure that
the identified hazards are prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.
Common examples of CCPs include cooking, cooling, hot holding, and cold holding of
ready-to-eat time/temperature control for safety foods. Due to vegetative and sporeand toxin-forming bacteria that are associated with raw animal foods, it is apparent that
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
564
 




the proper execution of control measures at each of these operational steps is essential
to prevent or eliminate food safety hazards or reduce them to acceptable levels.
(2) Are quality issues considered when determining CCPs?
CCPs are only used to address issues with product safety. Actions taken on the part of
the establishment such as first-in first-out (FIFO) or refrigerating non-time/temperature
control for safety foods are to ensure food quality rather than food safety and therefore
should not be considered as CCPs unless they serve a dual-purpose of ensuring food
safety.
(3) Are the CCPs the same for everyone?
Different facilities preparing similar food items may identify different hazards and the
CCPs. This can be due to differences in each facility's layout, equipment, selection of
ingredients, and processes employed. In mandatory HACCP systems, there may be
rigid regulatory requirements regarding what must be designated a CCP. In voluntary
HACCP systems, hazard control may be accomplished at CCPs or through prerequisite
programs. For instance, one facility may decide that it can best manage the hazards
associated with cooling through a standardized procedure in its prerequisite programs
rather than at a CCP in its HACCP plan. One tool that can be used to assist each
facility in the identification of CCPs unique to its operation is a CCP decision tree.

566 










(C) Principle #3: Establish Critical Limits
(1) What is a critical limit and what is its purpose?
A critical limit is a prescribed parameter (e.g., minimum and/or maximum value) that
must be met to ensure that food safety hazards are controlled at each CCP. A critical
limit is used to distinguish between safe and unsafe operating conditions at a CCP.
Each control measure at a CCP has one or more associated critical limits. Critical limits
may be based upon factors like temperature, time, moisture level, water activity (aw), or
pH. They must be scientifically-based and measurable.
(2) What are examples of critical limits?
Examples of critical limits are the time/temperature parameters for cooking chicken
(165 o
F for 15 seconds). In this case, the critical limit designates the minimum criteria
required to eliminate food safety hazards or reduce them to an acceptable level. The
critical limit for the acidification of sushi rice, a pH of <4.6, sets the maximum limit for
pH necessary to control the growth of spore- and toxin-forming bacteria. Critical limits
may be derived from regulatory standards such as the FDA Food Code, other
applicable guidelines, performance standards, or experimental results.
(D) Principle #4: Establish Monitoring Procedures
(1) What is the purpose of monitoring?
Monitoring is the act of observing and making measurements to help determine if
critical limits are being met and maintained. It is used to determine whether the critical
limits that have been established for each CCP are being met.
(2) What are examples of monitoring activities?
Examples of monitoring activities include visual observations and measurements of
time, temperature, pH, and water activity. If cooking chicken is determined to be a CCP
in an operation, then monitoring the internal temperature of a select number of chicken
pieces immediately following the cook step would be an example of a monitoring
activity. Alternatively, the temperature of an oven or fryer and the time required to
reach an internal temperature of 165 o
F could also be monitored.
(3) How is monitoring conducted?
Typically, monitoring activities fall under two broad categories:
• measurements

• observations

Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
567
 





Measurements usually involve time and temperature but also include other parameters
such as pH. If an operation identifies the acidification of sushi rice as a CCP and the
critical limit as the final pH of the product being < 4.6, then the pH of the product would
be measured to ensure that the critical limit is met.
Observations involve visual inspections to monitor the presence or absence of a food
safety activity. If date marking is identified as a CCP in a deli operation for controlling
Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat deli meats, then the monitoring activity could
involve making visual inspections of the date marking system to monitor the sell,
consume, or discard dates.
(4) How often is monitoring conducted?
Monitoring can be performed on a continuous or intermittent basis. Continuous
monitoring is always preferred when feasible as it provides the most complete
information regarding the history of a product at a CCP. For example, the temperature
and time for an institutional cook-chill operation can be recorded continuously on
temperature recording charts.
If intermittent monitoring is used, the frequency of monitoring should be conducted
often enough to make sure that the critical limits are being met.
(5) Who conducts monitoring?
Individuals directly associated with the operation (e.g., the person in charge of the
establishment, chefs, and departmental supervisors) are often selected to monitor
CCPs. They are usually in the best position to detect deviations and take corrective
actions when necessary. These employees should be properly trained in the specific
monitoring techniques and procedures used.
(E) Principle #5: Establish Corrective Actions
(1) What are corrective actions?
Corrective actions are activities that are taken by a person whenever a critical limit is
not met. Discarding food that may pose an unacceptable food safety risk to consumers
is a corrective action. However, other corrective actions such as further cooking or
reheating a product can be used provided food safety is not compromised. For
example, a restaurant may be able to continue cooking hamburgers that have not
reached an internal temperature of 155 o
F for 15 seconds until the proper temperature
is met. Clear instructions should be developed detailing who is responsible for
performing the corrective actions, the procedures to be followed, and when.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
568
 




(F)	 Principle #6: Establish Verification Procedures
(1)	 What is verification?
Verification includes those activities, other than monitoring, that determine the validity of
the HACCP plan and show that the system is operating according to the plan.
Validation is a component of verification which focuses on collecting and evaluating
scientific and technical information to determine if the HACCP system, when properly
implemented, will effectively control the hazards. Clear instructions should be
developed detailing who is responsible for conducting verification, the frequency of
verification, and the procedures used.
(2)	 What is the frequency of verification activities? What are some examples of
verification activities?
Verification activities are conducted frequently, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and
include the following:
• observing the person doing the monitoring and determining whether

monitoring is being done as planned

•	 reviewing the monitoring records to determine if they are completed
accurately and consistently

•	 determining whether the records show that the frequency of

monitoring stated in the plan is being followed

•	 ensuring that corrective action was taken when the person
monitoring found and recorded that the critical limit was not met

•	 validating that the critical limits are achieving the desired results of

controlling the identified hazard

•	 confirming that all equipment, including equipment used for

monitoring, is operated, maintained, and calibrated properly.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
569
 





(G) Principle #7: Establish Record Keeping Procedures
(1)	 Why are records important?
Maintaining documentation of the activities in a food safety management system can be
vital to its success. Records provide documentation that appropriate corrective actions
were taken when critical limits were not met. In the event that an establishment is
implicated in a foodborne illness, documentation of activities related to monitoring and
corrective actions can provide proof that reasonable care was exercised in the
operation of the establishment. Documenting activities provides a mechanism for
verifying that the activities in the HACCP plan were properly completed. In many cases,
records can serve a dual purpose of ensuring quality and food safety.
(2)	 What types of records are maintained as part of a food safety management
system?
There are at least 5 types of records that could be maintained to support a food safety
management system:
• records documenting the activities related to the prerequisite programs
• monitoring records
• corrective action records
• verification and validation records
• calibration records.
4.	 THE PROCESS APPROACH – A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF HACCP AT
RETAIL TO ACHIEVE ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL
(A)	 Why Focus on HACCP Principles at Retail and Food Service?
FDA recognizes that there are important differences between using HACCP principles
in a food safety management system developed for food manufacturing plants and
applying these same principles in food safety management system developed for use in
retail and food service establishments.
Since the 1980’s, operators and regulators have been exploring the use of the HACCP
principles in restaurants, grocery stores, institutional care facilities, and other retail food
establishments. During this time, much has been learned about how these principles
can be used in these varied operations, collectively referred to as retail food
establishments. Most of this exploration has centered around the focal question of how
to stay true to the NACMCF definitions of HACCP and still make the principles useful to
an industry that encompasses the broadest range of conditions.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
570
 








Unlike industries such as canning, other food processing, and dairy plants, the retail
industry is not easily defined by specific commodities or conditions. Consider the
following characteristics that retail food establishments share that set them apart from
most food processors:
1. Employee and management turnover is exceptionally high in food
establishments, especially for entry level positions. This means the many
employees or managers have little experience and food safety training must be
continuously provided.
2. Many establishments are start-up businesses operating without benefit of a large
corporate support structure and having a relatively low profit margin and perhaps
less capital to work with than other segments of the food industry.
3. There is an almost endless number of production techniques, products, menu
items, and ingredients used which are not easily adapted to a simple,
standardized approach. Changes occur frequently and little preparation time is
available.
FDA fully recognizes the diversity of retail and food service establishments and their
varying in-house resources to implement HACCP. That recognition is combined with an
understanding that the success of such implementation is dependent upon establishing
realistic and useful food safety strategies that are customized to the operation.
(B) What is the Process Approach?
When conducting the hazard analysis, food manufacturers usually use food
commodities as an organizational tool and follow the flow of each product. This is a
very useful approach for producers or processors since they are usually handling one
product at a time. By contrast, in retail and food service operations, foods of all types
are worked together to produce the final product. This makes a different approach to
the hazard analysis necessary. Conducting the hazard analysis by using the food
preparation processes common to a specific operation is often more efficient and useful
for retail and food service operators. This is called the "process approach" to HACCP.
The process approach can best be described as dividing the many food flows in an
establishment into broad categories based on activities or stages in the preparation of
the food, then analyzing the hazards, and placing managerial controls on each
grouping.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
571
 




(C)	 What are the three food preparation processes most often used in retail
and food service establishments and how are they determined?
The flow of food in a retail or food service establishment is the path that food follows

from receiving through service or sale to the consumer. Several activities or stages

make up the flow of food and are called operational steps.

Examples of operational steps include receiving, storing, preparing, cooking, cooling,

reheating, holding, assembling, packaging, serving, and selling. The terminology used
for operational steps may differ between food service and retail food store operations.

Most food items produced in a retail or food service establishment can be categorized
into one of three preparation processes based on the number of times the food passes

through the temperature danger zone between 41°F and 135°F:

• Process 1: Food Preparation with No Cook Step

Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Hold – Serve

(other food flows are included in this process, but there is no cook step to
destroy pathogens)
• Process 2: Preparation for Same Day Service
Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Cook – Hold – Serve
(other food flows are included in this process, but there is only one trip through
the temperature danger zone)
• Process 3: Complex Food Preparation
Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Cook – Cool – Reheat – Hot
Hold – Serve
(other food flows are included in this process, but there are always two or more
complete trips through the temperature danger zone)
A summary of the three food preparation processes in terms of number of times
through the temperature danger zone can be depicted in a Danger Zone diagram.
Although foods produced using process 1 may enter the danger zone, they do not pass
all the way through it. Foods that go through the danger zone only once are classified
as Same Day Service, while foods that go through more than once are classified as
Complex food preparation.

Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors

No Cook Same Day Complex
The three food preparation processes conducted in retail and food service
establishments are not intended to be all-inclusive. For instance, quick service facilities
may have “cook and serve” processes specific to their operation. These processes are
likely to be different from the “Same Day Service” preparation processes in full service
restaurants since many of their foods are generally cooked and hot held before service.
In addition, in retail food stores, operational steps such as packaging and assembly
may be included in all of the food preparation processes before the product is sold to
the consumer. It is also very common for a retail or food service operator to use
multiple food preparation processes to create a single menu item.
(D) How is a hazard analysis conducted in process HACCP?
In the process approach to HACCP, conducting a hazard analysis on individual food
items is time and labor intensive and is generally unnecessary. Identifying and
controlling the hazards in each food preparation process achieves the same control of
risk factors as preparing a HACCP plan for each individual product.
Example: An establishment has dozens of food items (including baked chicken and
baked meatloaf) in the “Preparation for Same Day Service” category. Each of the food
items may have unique hazards, but regardless of the individual hazards, control via
proper cooking and holding will generally ensure the safety of all of the foods in this
category. An illustration of this concept follows:
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
573
 









•	 Even though they have unique hazards, baked chicken and meatloaf are items
frequently grouped in the “Same Day Service” category (Process 2).
•	 Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter, as well as spore-formers, such as Bacillus
cereus and Clostridium perfringens, are significant biological hazards in chicken.
•	 Significant biological hazards in meatloaf include Salmonella spp., E. coli

O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens.

•	 Despite their different hazards, the control measure used to kill pathogens in
both these products is cooking to the proper temperature.
•	 Additionally, if the products are held after cooking, then proper hot holding or
time control is also required to prevent the outgrowth of spore-formers that are
not destroyed by cooking.
As with product-specific HACCP, critical limits for cooking remain specific to each food
item in the process. In the scenario described above, the cooking step for chicken
requires a final internal temperature of 165°F for 15 seconds to control the pathogen
load for Salmonella spp. Meatloaf, on the other hand, is a ground beef product and
requires a final internal temperature of 155°F for 15 seconds to control the pathogen
load for both Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7. Some operational steps such as
refrigerated storage or hot holding have critical limits that apply to all foods.
Annex 4, Table 4 further illustrates this concept. Note that the only unique control
measure applies to the critical limit of the cooking step for each of the products. Other
food safety hazards and control measures may exist that are not depicted here:
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors

(E) How is the process approach helpful to industry in determining the
measures that must be implemented to actively manage the foodborne illness
risk factors that result in out-of-control hazards?
Even though variations in foods and in the three food preparation process flows used to
prepare them are common, the control measures will generally be the same based on
the number of times the food goes through the temperature danger zone. Several of
the most common control measures associated with each food preparation process are
discussed in this Annex. Retail or food service establishments should use these simple
control measures as the core of their food safety management systems; however, there
may be other risk factors unique to an operation or process that are not listed here.
Each operation should be evaluated independently.
In developing a voluntary food safety management system, active managerial control of
risk factors common to each process can be achieved by implementing control
measures at certain operational steps designated as critical control points (CCPs) or by
implementing prerequisite programs. This is explained in more detail in the Operator’s
Manual discussed in Part 5 of this Annex.
(F) Facility-wide Considerations
In order to have active managerial control over personal hygiene and crosscontamination, certain control measures must be implemented in all phases of the
operation. All of the following control measures should be implemented regardless of
the food preparation process used:
•	 No bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods (or use of a pre-approved,
alternative procedure) to help prevent the transfer of viruses, bacteria, or
parasites from hands to food
•	 Proper handwashing to help prevent the transfer of viruses, bacteria, or

parasites from hands to food

•	 Restriction or exclusion of ill employees to help prevent the transfer of

viruses, bacteria, or parasites from hands to food

•	 Prevention of cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food or clean and sanitized
food-contact surfaces with soiled cutting boards, utensils, aprons, etc., or raw
animal foods.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
576
 





(G) Food Preparation Process 1 – Food Preparation with No Cook Step
Example Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE HOLD SERVE
Several food flows are represented by this particular process. Many of these food flows
are common to both retail food stores and food service facilities, while others only apply
to retail operations. Raw, ready-to-eat food like sashimi, raw oysters, and salads are
grouped in this category. Components of these foods are received raw and will not be
cooked before consumption.
Foods cooked at the processing level but that undergo no further cooking at the retail
level before being consumed are also represented in this category. Examples of these
kinds of foods are deli meats, cheeses, and other pasteurized dairy products (such as
yogurt). In addition, foods that are received and sold raw but are to be cooked by the
consumer after purchase, e.g., hamburger meat, chicken, and steaks, are also included
in this category.
All the foods in this category lack a cook step while at the retail or food service facility;
thus, there are no complete trips through the danger zone. Purchase specifications can
be required by the retail or food service establishment to ensure that foods are received
as safe as possible. Without a kill step to destroy pathogens, preventing further
contamination by ensuring that employees follow good hygienic practices is an
important control measure.
Cross-contamination must be prevented by properly storing ready-to-eat food away
from raw animal foods and soiled equipment and utensils. Foodborne illness may
result from ready-to-eat food being held at unsafe temperatures for long periods of time
due to the outgrowth of bacteria.
In addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety management system
involving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring active managerial
control over the following:
•	 Cold holding or using time alone to control bacterial growth and toxin
production

•	 Food source (e.g., shellfish due to concerns with viruses, natural toxins, and
Vibrio and for certain marine finfish intended for raw consumption due to
concerns with ciguatera toxin)
•	 Receiving temperatures (e.g., certain species of marine finfish due to concerns
with scombrotoxin)
•	 Date marking of ready-to-eat TCS food held for more than 24 hours to control
the growth of psychrophiles such as Listeria monocytogenes
•	 Freezing certain species of fish intended for raw consumption due to parasite
concerns
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
577
 











•	 Cooling from ambient temperature to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming or
toxin-forming bacteria.
(H) Food Preparation Process 2 – Preparation for Same Day Service
Example Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE COOK HOLD SERVE
In this food preparation process, food passes through the danger zone only once in the
retail or food service facility before it is served or sold to the consumer. Food is usually
cooked and held hot until served, e.g., fried chicken, but can also be cooked and
served immediately. In addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety
management system involving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring
active managerial control over the following:
• Cooking to destroy bacteria and parasites
•	 Hot holding or using time alone to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming
bacteria.
Approved food source, proper receiving temperatures, and proper cold holding before
cooking would also be important if dealing with certain marine finfish due to concerns
with ciguatera toxin and scombrotoxin.
(I) Food Preparation Process 3 – Complex Food Preparation
Example Flow: RECEIVE STORE PREPARE COOK COOL REHEAT
HOT HOLD SERVE
Foods prepared in large volumes or in advance for next day service usually follow an
extended process flow. These foods pass through the temperature danger zone more
than one time; thus, the potential for the growth of spore-forming or toxigenic bacteria is
greater in this process. Failure to adequately control food product temperatures is one
of the most frequently encountered risk factors contributing to foodborne illness. Food
handlers should minimize the time foods are at unsafe temperatures.
In addition to the facility-wide considerations, a food safety management system
involving this food preparation process should focus on ensuring active managerial
control over the following:
• Cooking to destroy bacteria and parasites
• Cooling to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming or toxin-forming bacteria
•	 Hot and cold holding or using time alone to control bacterial growth and toxin
formation
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
578
 





•	 Date marking of ready-to-eat TCS food held for more than 24 hours to control
the growth of psychrophiles such as Listeria monocytogenes
•	 Reheating for hot holding, if applicable.
Approved food source, proper receiving temperatures, and proper cold holding before
cooking would also be important if dealing with certain marine finfish due to concerns
with ciguatera toxin and scombrotoxin.
5.	 FDA RETAIL HACCP MANUALS
(A)	 What guidance has been developed by FDA to assist operators of retail and
food service establishments in achieving active managerial control of
foodborne illness risk factors?
FDA, in partnership with Federal, State, and local regulators, industry, academia, and
consumers, has written a guidance document entitled, “Managing Food Safety: A
Manual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles for Operators of Food Service and
Retail Establishments.” Commonly referred to as the “Operator’s Manual,” this
document is designed to assist operators with developing or enhancing food safety
management systems based on the process approach to HACCP. The manual
presents a step-by-step procedure for writing and voluntarily implementing a food safety
management system based on the principles of HACCP. The desired outcome is an
operator who employs a preventive rather than a reactive strategy to food safety.
The Operator’s Manual embodies FDA’s current thinking on the application of HACCP
principles at retail. It advocates the voluntary use of HACCP principles using the
process approach as a practical and effective means of reducing the occurrence of
foodborne illness risk factors leading to out-of-control hazards. The Operator’s Manual
is strictly for the voluntary implementation of HACCP principles at retail and should not
be used to develop HACCP plans that are required through Federal, State, or local
regulations, ordinances, or laws. The document can be found on the FDA Web Page at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm.
(B)	 What guidance has been developed by FDA to assist regulators of retail and
food service establishments in assessing industry’s active managerial
control of foodborne illness risk factors?
FDA has written a document for regulators of retail and food service establishments
entitled, “Managing Food Safety: A Regulator’s Manual for Applying HACCP Principles
to Risk-Based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary Food
Safety Management Systems.” Commonly referred to as the “Regulator’s Manual,” this
document was written to provide a risk-based inspectional "roadmap" for evaluating the
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
579
 







degree of active managerial control an operator has over foodborne illness risk factors.
In addition, the manual advocates the use of voluntary intervention strategies, including
the development of food safety management systems or risk control plans to bring
about a long-term behavior change that will result in a reduction in the occurrence of
risk factors. In cases where an operator may want their inspector to provide them with
feedback on their voluntarily-implemented food safety management system, the manual
provides regulators with information on how to validate and verify an existing system.
The document can be found on the FDA Web Page at:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm.
Annex 5 of the Food Code outlines the basis for conducting successful risk-based
inspections and is provided to assist industry in achieving active managerial control of
foodborne illness risk factors as outlined in the draft Recommended National Retail
Food Regulatory Program Standards and the Regulator’s Manual.
6.	 ADVANTAGES OF USING THE PRINCIPLES OF HACCP
(A)	 What advantages does using HACCP principles offer operators of retail and
food service establishments?
Rather than relying solely on periodic feedback from inspections by regulatory
agencies, an establishment operator who implements a food safety management
system based on HACCP principles emphasizes continuous problem solving and
prevention. Additionally, HACCP enhances and encourages communication between
industry and regulators.
A food safety management system based on HACCP principles offers many other
advantages to industry. One advantage is that such a system may provide a method
for achieving active managerial control of multiple risk factors associated with an entire
operation. Other advantages include:
• Reduction in product loss
• Increase in product quality
• Better inventory control
• Consistency in product preparation
• Increase in profit
• Increased employee awareness and participation in food safety.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
580
 






(B)	 What advantages does using HACCP principles offer regulators of retail
and food service establishments?
Traditional inspections are relatively resource-intensive, inefficient, and reactive rather
than preventive in nature. Using traditional inspection techniques allows for a
satisfactory “snapshot” assessment of the requirements of the code at the time of the
inspection. Unfortunately, unless an inspector asks questions and inquires about the
activities and procedures being utilized by the establishment even at times when the
inspector is not there, there is no way to know if an operator is achieving active
managerial control.
With the limited time often available for conducting inspections, regulators must focus
their attention on those areas that clearly have the greatest impact on food safety –
foodborne illness risk factors. By knowing that there are only a few control measures
that are essential to food safety and focusing on these during the inspection, an
inspector can assess the operator’s active managerial control of the foodborne illness
risk factors.
Regulators can provide invaluable feedback to an operator through their routine
inspections. This is especially useful when utilizing a risk-based approach. By
incorporating HACCP principles into routine inspections, an inspector can provide an
operator with the constructive input needed to establish the control system necessary to
bring the foodborne illness risk factors back under continuous control.
7. SUMMARY
In order to make a positive impact on foodborne illness, retail and food service
operators must achieve active managerial control of the risk factors contributing to
foodborne illness. Combined with basic sanitation, employee training, and other
prerequisite programs, the principles of HACCP provide an effective system for
achieving this objective.
The goal in applying HACCP principles in retail and food service is to have the operator
take purposeful actions to ensure safe food. The process approach simplifies HACCP
principles for use in retail and food service. This practical and effective method of
hazard control embodies the concept of active managerial control by providing an ongoing system of simple control measures that will reduce the occurrence of risk factors
that lead to out-of-control hazards.
Annex 4 – Management of Food Safety Practices – Achieving Active
Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors
581
 









The role of retail and food service regulatory professionals is to conduct risk-based
inspections using HACCP principles to assess the degree of control industry has over
the foodborne illness risk factors. Regulators can assist industry in achieving active
managerial control of risk factors by using a risk-based inspection approach to identify
strengths and weaknesses and suggesting possible solutions and improvements.

1.	 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This Annex provides regulatory program managers and front-line inspection staff with
guidance on planning, scheduling, conducting, and evaluating risk-based inspections.
The FDA’s Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Program
Standards)
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards
/default.htm ) provide additional recommendations to assist regulatory program
managers in the planning and development of a risk-based inspection program.
The primary focus of this Annex is to provide inspectors with methods for conducting
risk-based inspections. Various strategies that can be used by regulatory professionals
to assist operators in achieving active managerial control of foodborne illness risk
factors are also included in this Annex.
As presented in Annex 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Surveillance Report for 1993-1997, “Surveillance for Foodborne Disease Outbreaks –
United States” (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4901a1.htm ) identifies
the most frequently reported contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these
broad categories of contributing factors directly relate to food safety concerns within
retail and food service establishments and are collectively termed by the FDA as
“foodborne illness risk factors.”
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
587
 













These five broad categories are:
• Food from Unsafe Sources
• Inadequate Cooking
• Improper Holding Temperatures
• Contaminated Equipment
• Poor Personal Hygiene.
The FDA manual, Managing Food Safety: A Regulator’s Manual for Applying HACCP
Principles to Risk-based Retail and Food Service Inspections and Evaluating Voluntary
Food Safety Management Systems (FDA’s Regulator’s Manual)
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm), provides
additional information on conducting risk-based inspections. Annex 4 of the Food Code
provides additional information on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)
principles and the process approach to HACCP. It should be reviewed in conjunction
with the material found in this Annex to better prepare for performing risk-based
inspections.
The "Retail Food Program Resource Guide," a CD-ROM containing pertinent FDA
documents referenced in this Annex, is available for use by federal, state, local, and
tribal regulatory agencies. It is produced by and available through FDA Regional Retail
Food Specialists or the FDA Division of Federal-State Relations (HFC-150); U.S. Food
and Drug Administration; 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 12-07; Rockville, Maryland 20857;

2. RISK-BASED ROUTINE INSPECTIONS
Inspections have been a part of food safety regulatory activities since the earliest days
of public health. The term "routine inspection” has been used to describe periodic
inspections conducted as part of an on-going regulatory scheme.
Program managers should strive to have adequate staffing and resources to allow all
inspectors ample time to thoroughly evaluate establishments and ask as many
questions as needed to fully understand establishments’ operations. For most
jurisdictions, however, inspectors continue to have limited time in which to complete
inspections. This does not negate the need to thoroughly identify and assess the
control of foodborne illness risk factors during each inspection.
It is a false assumption that inspectors cannot conduct risk-based inspections in a
limited timeframe. Even with limited time, inspectors can focus their inspections on
assessing the degree of active managerial control an operator has over the foodborne
illness risk factors. By focusing inspections on the control of foodborne illness risk
factors, inspectors can be assured that they are making a great impact on reducing
foodborne illness.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
588
 














As described in Annex 4, active managerial control means the purposeful incorporation
of specific actions or procedures by industry management into the operation of their
businesses to attain control over foodborne illness risk factors. It embodies a
preventive rather than reactive approach to food safety through a continuous system of
monitoring and verification.
Developing and implementing food safety management systems to prevent, eliminate,
or reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors is recommended to achieve
active managerial control. Regulatory inspections and follow-up activities must be
proactive by using an inspection process designed to evaluate the implementation of
Food Code interventions and the degree of active managerial control that retail and
foodservice operators have over foodborne illness risk factors. The five Food Code
interventions below were new interventions introduced with the 1993 Food Code and
they are just as important today as they were in 1993. They encompass a wide-range
of control measures specifically designed to protect consumer health:
• Demonstration of Knowledge
• Implementation of Employee Health Policies
• Hands as a Vehicle of Contamination
• Time/Temperature Relationships
• Consumer Advisory.
When Food Code interventions are not being implemented or if behaviors, activities, or
procedures likely to cause foodborne illness are observed, inspectors should verify that
the operator takes immediate corrective action so that consumers do not become sick
or injured. Observations made on the day of the inspection, as well as information
gained about the behaviors, activities, and procedures that occur at other times, allow
inspectors to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the food safety management
system that is in place.
An operator should be made aware of the inspectional findings both during, and at the
conclusion of, the inspection and strategies for achieving compliance in the future
should be discussed. Corrective actions taken during the inspection and repeat
violations should be noted on the inspection report. Repeat violations should trigger
further compliance and enforcement actions.
The inspection process is also an opportunity to educate the operator on the public
health reasons supporting the Code requirements. If operators are afforded the chance
to ask questions about general food safety matters, they may clearly understand the
public health significance of non-compliance.
Lastly, if the operator demonstrates a history of violations related to foodborne illness
risk factors, the inspection process can be used to assist the operator with implementing
long-term control systems to prevent those risk factors from occurring in the future.

3. WHAT IS NEEDED TO PROPERLY CONDUCT A RISK-BASED INSPECTION?
A. Schedule Inspections Based on Risk
Studies have shown that the types of food served, the food preparation processes used,
the volume of food, and the population served all have a bearing on the occurrence of
foodborne illness risk factors in retail and foodservice establishments. Standard 3 of the
Program Standards requires that regulatory jurisdictions develop and use a process that
groups food establishments into at least three categories based on potential and
inherent food safety risks. In addition, Standard 3 requires that regulatory jurisdictions
assign inspection frequency based on the risk categories to focus program resources on
food operations with the greatest food safety risk. With limited resources, creating a
variable inspection frequency for each category will allow inspection staff to effectively
spend more time in high risk establishments that pose the greatest potential risk of
causing foodborne illness.
Table 1 of this Annex provides an example of risk categories and assignment of
inspection frequency based on risk. In this example, the type of food served, food
preparation processes conducted, and history of compliance related to foodborne illness
risk factors are used as the basis of categorizing risk. Each jurisdiction is encouraged
to develop risk categories tailored to their specific program needs and resources and to
reassess the risk categories on an annual basis.
Regardless of the risk category initially assigned to food establishments, regulatory
jurisdictions sometimes consider whether the establishment has implemented a
voluntary food safety management system like HACCP, to justify a decrease in
inspection frequency. Likewise, the following factors are among many that regulatory
jurisdictions sometimes use to justify an increase in inspection frequency:
•	 History of non-compliance with provisions related to foodborne illness risk factors
or critical items
•	 Specialized processes conducted
•	 Food preparation a day in advance of service
•	 Large number of people served
•	 History of foodborne illness and/or complaints
•	 Highly susceptible population served.

B. Have the Proper Equipment
In order to conduct risk-based inspections, each inspector must be provided with the
proper equipment to assess the control of foodborne illness risk factors within food
establishments. See Program Standard 8 at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/
default.htm for recommendations of equipment needed by inspectors. At a minimum,
each inspector should be provided with the following essential equipment:
• Thermocouple with the appropriate probes for the food being tested
• Alcohol swabs or other suitable equipment for sanitizing probe thermometers
• Chemical test kits for different chemical sanitizer types
• Heat-sensitive tape or maximum registering thermometer
• Flashlight
• Head cover, such as baseball cap, hair net, or equivalent.
Other equipment may be provided to inspectors on an “as needed” basis. While it is
desirable for each inspector to have the following equipment, depending on the
resources available to the agency, this equipment may be shared in a central office as
appropriate:
•	 Pressure gauge for determining in-line pressure of hot water at injection point of
warewashing machine (5-30 psi)
•	 Light meter
•	 Measuring device for measuring distances
•	 Time/temperature data logger
•	 pH meter
•	 Water activity meter
•	 Camera
•	 Computers with or without an electronic inspection system
•	 Black light
•	 Foodborne illness investigation kits
•	 Sample collection kits
•	 Cell phones.
C. Provide Adequate Training
Standard 2 of the Program Standards explains that regulatory staff shall have the
knowledge, skills, and ability to adequately perform their required duties. Inspectors
need the proper training before they can be expected to conduct risk-based inspections.
Training includes a combination of classroom training, in-field training, standardization,
and continuing education. For specific training recommendations refer to Program
Standard 2 at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/ProgramStandards/
default.htm and its accompanying Appendix B at the aforementioned website.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
592
 
















(1) Classroom Training
The first phase of staff training should provide an orientation to the program with a
review of program history, structure, and relationships to other food-related programs.
Specific emphasis should be on the program's goals and objectives. The basic training
curriculum should include the following components:
• Prevailing statutes, regulations, or ordinances
• Public health principles
• Communication skills
• Epidemiology
• Microbiology
• HACCP.
FDA’s ORA-U
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/ForStateLocalTribalRegulators/ucm121831.htm)
provides basic curriculum components free of charge to regulators via the internet. This
allows state, local, and tribal health departments to conserve their time and funding
resources instead of developing their own training courses. It also allows inspectors to
access training as needed. Distance learning allows government agencies and
industries to cost-effectively disseminate the most current technical and regulatory
information on an as-needed basis.
(2) Field Training and Experience
The second phase of training should move the new inspector into the field with a
training officer. On-site training should focus on specific inspection tasks such as
interviewing, making observations, measuring conditions such as temperatures and
sanitizer strength, assessing the control operators have over the foodborne illness risk
factors, ensuring implementation of Food Code interventions, and completing the
inspection form. If an electronic database is used by the agency, training in its use
should be included in this phase.
The evaluation of food safety management systems based on HACCP principles should
be part of the field training experience. The trainee and the trainer should review
establishment menus, operations, recipes, and standard operating procedures.
Inspectors should be able to demonstrate proficiency in gathering information about the
food preparation processes, including accurate charting of the food flows and
determination of the Critical Control Points (CCPs) and critical limits in an operation.
This part of the training should also include a familiarization with the compliance and
enforcement protocol in place in the jurisdiction including recommendation of voluntary
strategies to prevent risk factor occurrence.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
593
 














(3) Standardization
The third part of staff training should include standardization. This process improves
uniformity in the application and interpretation of applicable regulations, inspection
methodology, and report writing. The Program Standards recommend that staff
conducting inspections undergo a standardization process similar to the one described
in the FDA Procedures for Standardization and Certification of Retail Food Inspection/
Training Officers
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/InspectionsQuality
Assurance/ucm2006814.htm ). Standardization should be completed after the trainee
completes classroom and field training.
(4) Continuing Education
The training process for inspection staff should be continuous. The final phase of
training should include a mechanism to ensure that learning is ongoing and staff is kept
abreast of food safety issues and the latest science.
D. Ensure Adequate Program Resources
As indicated in Standard 8 of the Program Standards, regulatory agencies should have
adequate funding, staff, and equipment necessary to support a risk-based retail food
safety program designed to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors.
Program management should do everything they can to secure funding and resources
to support regulatory food programs.
Standard 8 of the Program Standards also states that the program budget should
provide the necessary resources to develop and maintain a retail food safety program
that has a staffing level of one full-time equivalent (FTE) devoted to food for every 280 ­
320 inspections performed. Inspections, for purposes of this calculation, include routine
inspections, re-inspections, complaint investigations, outbreak investigations,
compliance follow-up inspections, risk assessment reviews, process reviews, variance
process reviews, and other direct establishment contact time such as on-site training.
4. RISK-BASED INSPECTION METHODOLOGY
A. Focus the Inspection
Conducting a risk-based inspection requires inspectors to focus their efforts on
evaluating the degree of active managerial control that operators have over foodborne
illness risk factors. In addition, it is essential that the implementation of Food Code
interventions also be verified during each inspection. Inspectors need to spend the
majority of their time observing the behaviors, practices, and procedures that are likely
to lead to out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors and asking management and food
employees questions to supplement actual observations.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
594
 













Retail and food service operators implement “control measures” to ensure food safety.
Control measures are actions or activities that are used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce
food safety hazards. Inspectors need to determine the control measures that should be
implemented to prevent the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors in each food
preparation process. In order to determine the foodborne illness risk factors common to
each operation, it is important for inspectors to understand that the food preparation
processes and all the associated control measures initiated by a retail or food service
operator represent a food safety management system. It will be necessary for
inspectors to ask questions in order to gain information about the system already in
place. Once the degree of active managerial control is determined, inspectors will be
able to assist operators with strengthening their existing food safety management
systems.
B. Lead by Example
Nonverbal communication is just as important as verbal communication in relaying
important food safety principles to retail and food service operators. By setting the
example during inspections, inspectors not only demonstrate competency, but they also
relay important food safety information to the person in charge and food employees.
The following are ways that inspectors set the example during inspections:
•	 Washing their hands when entering the food preparation area at the beginning
of the inspection and after engaging in any activities that might contaminate
their hands
•	 Not working when they are suffering from symptoms such as diarrhea, fever,
vomiting, or jaundice or if they are diagnosed with a disease transmittable by
food
•	 Being careful not to touch ready-to-eat (RTE) food with their bare hands
•	 Washing and sanitizing their thermocouple probe at the start of the inspection
and between foods
•	 Using a proper hair restraint and practicing good personal hygiene
•	 Being careful not to contaminate clean and sanitized food contact-surfaces
with unclean hands or their inspection equipment.
C. Conduct Inspections at Variable Times
Inspectors should enter the food establishment during hours of operation or at other
reasonable times. Inspectors should show identification and provide the permit holder
or person in charge with a verbal or written notice of the purpose of the inspection.
Procedures outlined in the Food Code and in the jurisdiction’s procedures should be
followed if access to conduct an inspection is denied. Refusal should be documented
on the inspection report and an administrative or judicial inspection order obtained.
In planning for inspections, inspectors should consider the importance of timing.
Several operational steps at retail such as receiving, preparation, and cooling can be
evaluated only during limited time periods. In order to properly evaluate critical
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
595
 

















processes that occur outside of the normal 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. working hours, an inspector
should be allowed the flexibility to conduct inspections early in the morning, late in the
evening, and even on weekends.
D. Establish Inspection Priorities and Use Inspection Time Wisely
With the limited time allotted for inspections, inspectors must develop clear priorities to
make the most efficient use of their time in each food establishment. Although basic
sanitation issues generally do not change during the course of an inspection, critical
behaviors, practices, and procedures leading to foodborne illness risk factors may be
only observable during limited time periods of the preparation or cooling process. For
this reason, assessment of the active managerial control of foodborne illness risk
factors should generally be performed before reviewing basic sanitation issues.
To effectively set priorities, the following four activities should be completed early in the
inspection:
(1) Establish an open dialogue with the person in charge
(2) Review previous inspection records
(3) Conduct a menu or food list review
(4) Conduct a quick walk-though.
(1) Establish an Open Dialogue with the Person in Charge
The tone of the inspection is often set during the first few minutes of the inspection.
A professional but personable approach is the balance which should be maintained.
Genuine interest in the food establishment and the staff translates into good relations
which may be helpful in conveying the goal of promoting public health. Having an open
dialogue with the person in charge during all phases of the inspection gives inspectors
an opportunity to learn important information about the existing food safety
management system.
It is important to know both the strengths and weaknesses of the existing food safety
management system early in the inspection in order to focus the inspection on weak
areas. Questions about practices and procedures related to foodborne illness risk
factors and Food Code interventions such as the establishment’s employee health
policy and consumer advisory notice should be asked during all phases of the
inspection. It is important to ask enough questions to fully understand the system being
utilized in the food establishment. This is especially true when evaluating whether the
employees are adhering to the established no bare hand contact and handwashing
policies. Asking the person in charge questions about important activities such as
receiving, cooling, and preparation is also important in relaying the importance of out-ofcontrol foodborne illness risk factors.
The person in charge should be encouraged to accompany inspectors during the
inspection. This may ultimately save time since violations can be pointed out and
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
596
 




















corrected as they are observed. In addition, the importance of violations related to
foodborne illness risk factors and Food Code interventions is more apparent if they are
pointed out during the inspection rather than waiting until the end. Violations should be
marked on the inspection form even if immediate corrective actions are taken.
Corrective actions taken should also be recorded on the inspection form. Inspectors
can also use this time to share knowledge about critical processes. By communicating
the public health rationale behind the regulations, inspectors will leave the person in
charge with a clear understanding for why active managerial control of foodborne illness
risk factors must be a top priority in the day-to-day operation of the business.
Early in the inspection, inspectors should inquire about activities that are presently
occurring. Processes that occur over time like cooling and reheating also need to be
assessed over time; thus, inspectors should ask in the beginning of the inspection if any
foods are currently being cooled or reheated.
It is important for inspectors to allow the operator a chance to discuss issues related to
food safety. One-way communication in which inspectors do all the talking is not
conducive to a risk-based philosophy. An effective risk-based inspection is dependent
on inspectors’ ability to maintain two-way communication in order to properly assess
behaviors, processes, and procedures that occur in the food establishment.
(2) Review Previous Inspection Reports
In order to detect trends of out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors, it is important for
inspectors to review past inspection reports before conducting an inspection. This can
be done in the office or on-site in the food establishment. This activity is especially
important in jurisdictions where inspectors rotate from one inspection to the next. If the
same foodborne illness risk factor is out-of-control during more than one inspection, it is
strongly recommended that the operator develop an intervention strategy to prevent its
recurrence. Intervention strategies are discussed later in this Annex.
Knowledge of what has been corrected from the last inspection also gives inspectors an
opportunity to provide positive feedback to the operator and allows inspectors to track
corrected violations in accordance with their jurisdiction’s policies and procedures.
(3) Conduct a Menu/Food List Review
Menus, including all written and verbal lists of foods prepared and offered in a food
establishment, can be reviewed in a fairly simple manner. The review can either be
done simultaneously with a quick walk-through of the operation or at the beginning of
the inspection as a discussion with management. The menu/food list also does not
need to be reviewed during every inspection. If a review was done during a recent
inspection, inspectors should inquire about new items, seasonal items, substitutions, or
changes in preparation since the last menu review was conducted.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
597
 

















A review of the menu/food list allows inspectors to begin to group food items into one of
three broad process categories (discussed in Annex 4 of the Food Code and later in this
Annex). Mentally grouping products by process assists inspectors in focusing the
inspection on the control measures critical to each process. Conducting a review of the
menu/food list also allows inspectors to establish inspection priorities by identifying:
•	 High-risk foods or high-risk food preparation processes
•	 Operational steps requiring further inquiry such as receiving, preparation,
cooking, and cooling.
By identifying high-risk foods or high-risk food preparation processes, inspectors can
focus the inspection on those foods or processes that are more likely to cause
foodborne illness if uncontrolled. The menu/food list review might be the only time
inspectors are made aware of specialized processes such as formulating a food so that
it is not time/temperature control for safety food (TCS) or high-risk seasonal menu items
such as “raw oysters on the half shell.” Foods such as shellstock and certain fish for
raw consumption require documentation that should be reviewed during the inspection.
If Caesar salad or hollandaise sauce is served, further inquiry is needed regarding the
preparation of these items since they are sometimes prepared with raw or undercooked
eggs.
Several operational steps like receiving, preparation, cooking, and cooling may not be
inspected as vigorously in retail and food service inspections due, in part, to the hours
of the day in which these steps occur. If a food establishment is inspected in the
afternoon hours, for example, receiving and food preparation might have already
occurred. In order to evaluate the establishment’s active managerial control of
foodborne illness risk factors, it is imperative that inspectors ask enough questions to
obtain information about the operational steps that they cannot directly observe during
the current inspection.
(4) Conduct a Quick Walk-through
As inspectors discuss the menu or food list and establishes open communication with
the person in charge, it is suggested that they conduct a quick walk-through of the food
establishment to observe what is going on at that time. Conducting a quick walkthrough is especially important to observe several activities that might otherwise go
unnoticed or unobserved until later in the inspection, including:
•	 Receiving
•	 Food preparation and handling
•	 Cooking
•	 Cooling
•	 Reheating.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
598
 

















Speaking directly to the food service employees preparing the food is also an excellent
way to assess the effectiveness of the establishment’s food safety training and standard
operating procedures for critical processes such as cooling. Noting that receiving or
food preparation is occurring at the beginning of the inspection allows inspectors an
opportunity to take advantage of viewing “real-life” production processes and will help
inspectors to obtain a clear picture of the establishment's true practices. Receiving and
food preparation only occur during limited times, so inspectors may want to stop and
observe these operational steps while they are happening.
Early in the inspection, temperatures of time/temperature control for safety foods (TCS)
should be taken. For example, if inspecting in the morning, inspectors should check the
temperatures of last night’s stored leftovers. If inspecting in the afternoon, inspectors
should check the temperatures of foods prepared that morning that are now cooling.
Also, inspectors should ask whether any foods are currently being cooked or reheated.
E. Determine Process Flows
Many retail and food service establishments have implemented effective food safety
management systems by establishing controls for the food preparation methods and
processes common to their operation. Control of food preparation processes rather
than individual food items is often called the “process approach” to HACCP. The
process approach using the principles of HACCP can best be described as dividing the
many food items in an operation into food preparation processes then analyzing the
foodborne illness risk factors associated with each process. By placing managerial
controls on specific operational steps in the flow of food, foodborne illness can be
prevented.
As presented in Annex 4 of the Food Code, most food items produced in a retail or food
service establishment can be categorized into one of three preparation processes
based on the number of times the food passes through the temperature danger zone
between 41o F and 135o F. In conducting risk-based inspections, it is necessary for an
inspector to be knowledgeable regarding how food is prepared in the operation.
Knowing how products are prepared in an establishment allows inspectors to focus their
inspections on the critical procedures and steps in the preparation of those products.
F. Determine Foodborne Illness Risk Factors In Process Flows
Annex 4 of the Food Code details the essential control measures specific to each food
preparation process, in addition to essential facility-wide control measures. Inspectors
should generally focus their inspections on verifying that operators have implemented
control measures to control for foodborne illness risk factors common to the processes
conducted in each operation. There may be other foodborne illness risk factors unique
to specific operations; thus, inspectors should independently evaluate each operation
and food preparation process conducted.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
599
 

















G.	 Assess Active Managerial Control of Foodborne Illness Risk Factors and
Implementation of Food Code Interventions
Although some food establishments have formal HACCP plans, many do not. Even
without a HACCP system, every food establishment needs to have active managerial
control of foodborne illness risk factors. This may be achieved through several means,
such as training programs, manager oversight, or standard operating procedures. For
example, some food establishments incorporate control measures into individual
recipes, production schedules, or employee job descriptions to achieve active
managerial control.
While a person in charge may require the maintenance of in-house written records by
employees to ensure that monitoring is being performed using the correct method and
at the proper frequency, foodborne illness risk factors may be managed without the use
of formal record keeping. Monitoring, whether through direct observations or by taking
appropriate measurements, is by far the most important step in ensuring food safety. If
an operator is effectively monitoring all critical activities in the food establishment and
taking corrective actions when needed, safe food will result. With a few exceptions,
maintaining formal records at retail is not required; therefore, records may not be in
place for use during the inspection. As a result, it will be necessary to use direct
observations and interviewing to determine whether a food establishment is adequately
monitoring foodborne illness risk factors in their existing food safety management
system.
This section provides a comprehensive discussion of how to assess the active
managerial control of each of the foodborne illness risk factors and the implementation
of each of the Food Code interventions. Assessment of active managerial control
involves more than determining compliance with Food Code provisions. In assessing
whether the operator has active managerial control, inspectors should observe whether
the operator has established the appropriate control measures and critical limits and
whether appropriate monitoring and corrective action procedures are in place and
followed. In addition, inspectors should assess whether managers and employees are
knowledgeable of food safety principles and critical practices and procedures necessary
to prevent foodborne illness. If during the inspection inspectors observes that control
measures are not being implemented appropriately to control risk factor occurrence,
immediate corrective action must be taken.
(1)	 Demonstration of Knowledge
It is the responsibility of the person in charge to ensure compliance with the Code.
Knowledge and application of Food Code provisions are vital to preventing foodborne
illness and injury. Data collected by FDA suggest that having a certified food manager
on-site has a positive effect on the occurrence of certain foodborne illness risk factors in
the industry.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
600
 

















In order to assess whether the person in charge demonstrates knowledge, inspectors
should verify that the person in charge has one or more of the following:
•	 A valid food protection manager certificate
•	 No priority item violations during the current inspection
•	 Correct responses to food safety related questions as presented in
¶ 2-102.11(C) of the Food Code.
(2)	 Assessing Safe Sources and Receiving Temperatures
The time and day of the inspection is important when assessing whether foods are
received from safe sources and in sound condition. Foods may be received in the food
establishment on set days. Inspectors should ask questions to ascertain the day or
days that deliveries are received and also the receiving procedures in place by the food
establishment. Inspections can be scheduled at times when it is known that products
will be received by the food establishment. If food is being delivered during the
inspection, inspectors should:
•	 Verify internal product temperatures
•	 Examine package integrity upon delivery
•	 Look for signs of temperature abuse (e.g., large ice crystals in the packages
of frozen products)
•	 Examine delivery truck and products for potential for cross-contamination
•	 Observe the food establishment’s behaviors and practices as they relate to
the establishment’s control of contamination and holding and cooling
temperatures of received products
•	 Review receiving logs and other documents, product labels, and food
products to ensure that foods are received from regulated food processing
plants (no foods prepared at home) and at the proper temperature.
When evaluating approved sources for shellfish, such as clams, oysters, and mussels,
inspectors should ask whether shellfish are served at any time during the year. If so,
inspectors should review the tags or labels to verify that the supplier of the shellfish is
certified and on the most current Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List found at
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FederalStateFoodPrograms/ucm200675
3.htm ). Inspectors should note whether all required information is provided on the tags
or label (harvester’s certification number, harvest waters and date, type and quantity of
shellfish and similar information for each dealer that handles the shellfish after the
harvester). Shellstock tags should also be retained for 90 days in chronological order.
With regard to fish, inspectors should verify that fish are commercially caught and
harvested and received from reputable vendors. If fish are being delivered during the
inspection or if they were received just before inspectors’ arrival, temperatures should
be taken, especially if there are finfish such as tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, mackerel, and
snapper. These fish are subject to scombrotoxin formation if time/temperature abused.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
601
 













Inspectors should verify freshness by conducting an organoleptic inspection of the gills,
eyes, and bodies of the fish.
Inspector should verify that fish, except for certain species of tuna, intended for raw or
undercooked consumption have been frozen for the required time and temperature
parameters to destroy parasites by either reviewing freezing records or verifying that a
letter of guarantee from the purveyor is kept on file. If freezing is conducted on-site,
inspectors should verify that the freezing records are maintained for at least 90 days
beyond the date of sale or service.
With regard to the service of game or wild mushrooms, inspectors should ask if these
products are served at any time during the year. If so, inspectors should verify that they
are from an approved source by reviewing invoices.
With regard to juice and milk products, inspectors should verify that fluid milk and milk
products are pasteurized and received at the proper temperature. For packaged juice,
inspectors should verify that the juice was pasteurized or otherwise treated to achieve a
5-log reduction of the most resistant microorganism.
During the inspection, inspectors should inquire as to the source of foods that have
been removed from their original containers. If at any time during the inspection there is
any doubt as to the source of certain products, inspectors should ask for invoices or
receipts to demonstrate their source. Certain products, such as flat breads, waffles,
pies, and cakes may require special cooking equipment to prepare. If suitable
equipment is not on-site to prepare such products and the products are not stored in
original containers, then inspectors should inquire as to the source of these products.
Food from unapproved, unsafe, or otherwise unverifiable sources should be discarded
or put on hold or under embargo until appropriate documentation is provided. In
addition, inspectors should ensure that management and employees are aware of the
risk of serving or selling food from unapproved sources. Fish that are intended to be
consumed raw or undercooked and for which no freezing certification or equipment is
found on-site, can be used in menu items that will be fully cooked. If cooking is not an
option due to the menu items served, the fish should be discarded.
(3)	 Assessing Contaminated Equipment and Potential for CrossContamination

This risk factor involves the proper storage and use of food products and equipment to
prevent cross-contamination. The cleaning, sanitization, and storage of food-contact
surfaces of equipment and utensils in a manner to prevent transmission of foodborne
pathogens or contamination is also included in this risk factor.
As inspectors walk through the food establishment, they should examine food storage
areas for proper storage, separation, segregation, and protection from contamination.
Inspectors should look to see that raw animal foods and ready-to-eat foods are
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
602
 


















separated during receiving, storage, and preparation. For example, cooked shrimp
should not be returned to the same container that previously held uncooked product.
Cutting boards should be washed, rinsed, and sanitized between trimming uncooked
chicken and cooked steak.
In addition, raw animal foods should be separated by cooking temperatures such that
foods requiring a higher cooking temperature, like chicken, should be stored below or
away from foods requiring a lower temperature, like pork and beef. If TCS foods are not
being cooled, they should be covered or packaged while in cold storage.
Following the flow of food as it is prepared in the food establishment may alert
inspectors to opportunities for cross-contamination. When contamination has occurred
between raw and ready-to-eat food, inspectors should assess whether the food can be
reconditioned. In some cases, depending on the affected food, it may be possible to
reheat the food to eliminate any hazards. If the food cannot be reconditioned, then the
food should be discarded.
Inspectors should verify that exposed food such as chips, bread, and dipping sauces
are not re-served to the consumer. Consumer self-service operations are addressed in
the Code with regard to the types of food offered for consumer self-service, the
protection of food on display, and the required monitoring by employees of such
operations.
A visual check of the food-contact surfaces of equipment and utensils should be made
to verify that the utensils are maintained clean and sanitized using the approved manner
and frequency. Utensils that are observed to have debris, grease, or other visible
contamination should be rewashed and resanitized.
Observations should be made to determine whether practices are in place to eliminate
the potential for contamination of utensils, equipment, and single-service items by
environmental contaminants, employees, and consumers. When clean equipment and
utensils are stored where they are subject to environmental contamination such as near
handwashing sinks or prep sinks, inspectors should have the operator rearrange the
equipment in a manner to prevent cross-contamination. Depending on the
circumstances, the operator may need to rewash and resanitize the equipment.
Inspectors should observe handwashing operations. If handwashing sinks and fixtures
are located where splash may contaminate food contact surfaces or food, then splash
guards should be installed or food-contact surfaces should be relocated to prevent
cross-contamination.
Inspectors should pay particular attention to prep sinks, especially those that are
currently in use at the time of the inspection. Built-up grime is a visible sign that the sink
is not being washed, rinsed, and sanitized appropriately before use. If there are
designated vegetable or meat sinks, inspectors should verify that the placement of sinks
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
603
 

















and food preparation areas do not facilitate opportunities for cross-contamination from
one to the other.
With regard to the cleaning and sanitization of food-contact surfaces, inspectors should
verify the compliance of any warewashing operations by ensuring that cleaning and
sanitizing procedures for all food-contact surfaces conform to the requirements in the
Food Code. Questions should be asked to assess how utensils and cookware are
washed, rinsed, and sanitized in the food establishment. When assessing the
warewashing procedure and equipment, inspectors should pay particular attention to
cooking and baking equipment that is too large to fit in the dishmachine or sinks. It is a
good idea to have the person responsible for dishwashing demonstrate the procedure
that is followed in the food establishment by setting up the sinks and watching the
dishwashing procedure.
(4) Assessing Cooking Temperatures
Food cooking temperatures and times should be verified by inspectors during each
inspection. Every effort should be made to assess the cooking temperatures of a
variety of products served in the food establishment.
To assess cooking, inspections must occur at times when food is being cooked. It is
also important to conduct inspections during busy times, such as lunch and dinner, as
there may be a tendency for the operator to rush the cooking of foods during these
times.
Critical limits for cooking TCS foods in the Food Code include specifications that all
parts of the food be heated to a certain temperature. For large roasts, temperature
measurement should take into account post-cooking heat rise which allows the
temperature to reach equilibrium throughout the food. The critical limit of time at the
terminal temperature must also be measured during inspections. For example, a roast
beef cooked at 54°C (130°F) is required to be held at this temperature for 112 minutes
to ensure destruction of pathogens. Cooking times and temperatures should be noted
on the inspection report.
The correct temperature measuring device and technique are essential in accurately
determining the temperatures of TCS foods. The geometric center or thickest part of a
product are the points of measurement of product temperature particularly when
measuring critical limits for cooking.
Inspectors should take internal temperatures of products using a thermocouple or
thermistor with a probe suitable for the product thickness. A thin diameter probe should
be used for temperature measurements of hamburger patties and fish filets.
Alternately, although less desirable, an inspector may use a suitable, calibrated bimetal
stem thermometer for checking cooking temperatures of thick foods. Infrared
thermometers are inappropriate for measuring internal cooking temperatures.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
604
 


















In order to better assess cooking during all phases of the inspection, inspectors could
enlist the help of cooperative food employees to notify them of foods that have finished
cooking. This allows inspectors to continue with the inspection in other areas of the
operation yet continue to verify that proper cooking temperatures are being met.
Food establishments should routinely monitor cooking temperatures. Inspections
should verify that monitoring is occurring by involving the person in charge in these
activities during the regulatory inspection. The presence of required thermometers and
their proper use should be assessed.
Comparisons should be made between inspectors’ calibrated temperature measuring
device and those used by the food establishment. Notation of deviations should be
made on the inspection report. Inspectors should ask food establishment personnel to
demonstrate proper calibration of their temperature measuring devices.
If required cooking temperatures are not met, inspectors should have the operator
continue cooking the food until the proper temperature is reached. Additionally,
inspectors should explain the public health significance of inadequate cooking to
management and food employees.
(5) Assessing Holding Time and Temperatures and Date Marking
Hot and cold holding temperatures, as well as cooling time and temperatures, of TCS
foods should be thoroughly checked with a thermocouple, thermistor, or other
appropriate temperature measuring device during each inspection. This includes the
temperature of TCS food during transport, e.g., hot holding carts being used to transport
food to patient rooms in a hospital, satellite kitchens, or off-site catering events. As a
rule, every effort should be made to assess every hot and cold holding unit in the food
establishment during a risk-based inspection.
Use of an infrared thermometer for verifying holding temperatures is not consistent with
Food Code requirements since verifying only the surface temperature of the food may
not alert inspectors to problems that exist under the food’s surface. Such problems
could stem from improper cooling, in the case of cold-held foods, or improper reheating,
in the case of hot-held foods. In addition, inspectors should not stir a food before taking
its temperature since it is important to know the temperature of the food before it is
agitated.
The geometric center of a product is usually the point of measurement of product
temperature particularly when measuring the critical limit for cold holding.
The hot holding critical limit may need additional measurements taken at points farthest
from the heat source, e.g., near the product surface for food held on a steam table.
Temperatures monitored between packages of food, such as cartons of milk or
packages of meat, may indicate the need for further examination. However, the
temperature of a TCS food itself, rather than the temperature between packages, is
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
605
 
















necessary for regulatory citations. In large holding units and on steam tables, it is
necessary to take the temperatures of foods in various locations to ensure that the
equipment is working properly. If deviations are noted in the product temperatures, it is
important to take extra steps to find out whether the problem is the result of equipment
failure or whether a breakdown in a process such as cooling or reheating is the reason
for the problem.
Corrective actions for foods found in violation should be required based on the
jurisdiction’s regulatory food code. If foods are to be discarded, forms such as those
used for stop sale or embargo may need to be completed and signed by the person in
charge in accordance with the jurisdiction’s regulatory food code. In order to properly
evaluate the degree of time and temperature abuse and the proper disposition of the
affected food, several issues must be considered. Answers to these questions, in
combination with observations made during the inspection, should provide inspectors
with enough information to make the appropriate recommendation for on-site correction:
•	 Are there any written procedures in place for using time alone as a public
health control and, if so, are they being followed properly?
•	 What are the ingredients of the food and how was it made?
•	 Is it likely that the food contains Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium
botulinum, or Bacillus cereus as hazards?
•	 Has there been an opportunity for post-cook contamination with raw animal
foods or contaminated equipment?
•	 If there has been an opportunity for post-cook contamination, can the hazards
of concern be eliminated by reheating?
•	 Are the food employees practicing good personal hygiene including frequent
and effective handwashing?
•	 Was the food reheated or cooked to the proper temperature before being
allowed out of temperature control?
•	 What is the current temperature of the food when taken with a probe
thermometer?
•	 How long has the food been out of temperature control (ask both the manager
and food employees)? Are the answers of the food employees and the
manager consistent with one another?
•	 Is it likely that food has cooled to its current temperature after being out of
temperature control for the alleged time?
•	 Will the food be saved as leftovers?
•	 How long before the food will be served?
•	 Given what is known about the food, the food’s temperature, the handling of
the food, and the alleged time out of temperature, is it reasonably likely that
the food already contains hazards that cannot be destroyed by reheating?
Even if food can be reconditioned by reheating, steps should be taken by the person in
charge to ensure compliance in the future. Examples include repairing malfunctioning
or inoperative equipment or implementing a risk control plan (RCP) to modify
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
606
 




















preparation procedures or to institute a procedure for monitoring holding temperatures
of food.
If using time only or time-temperature combinations in lieu of temperature for controlling
the growth and toxin-formation of pathogenic bacteria, strict controls must be in place
and followed. Inspectors should verify that the written procedures are on-site and
followed in accordance with the Food Code.
Date marking is the mechanism by which active managerial control of time-temperature
combinations can prevent the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in TCS, ready-to-eat
foods during cold storage. With exceptions, all ready-to-eat, TCS foods prepared onsite and held for more than 24 hours should be date marked to indicate the day or date
by which the foods need to be served or discarded. Inspectors should ask questions to
ascertain whether the system in place to control for L. monocytogenes meets the intent
of the Food Code. Food that should be date marked and is not should be discarded.
(6) Assessing Reheating for Hot Holding
In order to assess a food establishment’s control of reheating for hot holding, the time of
day that the inspection occurs is a key factor. Every effort should be made to schedule
an inspection during pre-opening preparation. If inspections are conducted during preopening preparation or other preparation periods, inspectors should ask questions
regarding the history of hot-held foods. Foods in compliance for minimum hot holding
temperatures may have in fact been improperly reheated before being placed into hot
holding units or steam tables.
If items are found “reheating” on the steam table, further inquiry is needed to assess
whether the equipment in question is capable of reheating the food to the proper
temperature within the maximum time limit. Corrective action for foods found out of
compliance for reheating for hot holding would depend on how long the food had been
out of temperature and other factors. In most cases, however, the food may be rapidly
reheated and hot held.
(7) Assessing Cooling
Improper cooling remains a major contributor to bacterial foodborne illness. Cooling
temperatures and times need to be closely evaluated during every inspection. In order
to assess whether a food establishment has control over cooling, the time of day that
the inspection occurs is critical. Early morning inspections allow an opportunity to verify
that leftovers from the night before were cooled properly or cooled using a proper
cooling method. Alternatively, afternoon inspections may allow an inspector to verify
cooling of products that may have been prepared that morning.
Because many food establishments prepare bulk products only on certain days of the
week, it is essential that inspectors become as familiar as possible with each operation
and schedule their inspections accordingly.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
607
 















Due to the time parameters involved in cooling, inspectors should always inquire at the
beginning of the inspection whether there are any products currently being cooled. This
allows inspectors an opportunity to take initial temperatures of the products and still
have time to re-check temperatures later in the inspection in order to verify that critical
limits are being met.
Problems with cooling can often be discovered through inquiry alone. Even when no
cooling is taking place, inspectors should ask the food employees and managers
questions about the cooling procedures in place.
When examining cold holding units, bulk containers and buckets, tightly packed pans,
shrouded rolling racks, or closed rolling cabinets should warrant further temperature and
time investigation. Bulk containers and buckets should be opened since they are
commonly reused for food storage and cooling.
The geometric center of a product is often chosen as the point of measurement of
product temperature particularly when measuring the critical limits for cooling. For
foods that are being cooled, temperature profiles throughout the product may show
proper temperatures at outer edges and hot spots at the core of the product. Inspectors
can verify cooling by first taking a temperature measurement in the geometric center of
the product, then at various points around the perimeter of the product. Warmer
temperatures in the center of the product, in combination with cooler temperatures
around the perimeter, indicate that a product is cooling. Additional questions should be
asked to ascertain the cooling time parameters of the food in question. Information
gained from food employees and management, in combination with temperature
measurements taken, should form the basis for assessing compliance of cooling during
an inspection.
The following guidance may be used for determining the appropriate corrective action
for improper cooling. Cooked hot food may be reheated to 165 ºF for 15 seconds and
the cooling process started again using a different cooling method if the food is:
• Above 70 ºF and two hours or less into the cooling process; and
• Above 41 ºF and six hours or less into the cooling process.
Cooked hot food should be discarded immediately if the food is:
• Above 70 ºF and more than two hours into the cooling process; or
• Above 41 ºF and more than six hours into the cooling process.
A different, more accelerated, cooling method may be used for prepared ready-to-eat
foods if the food is above 41 ºF and less than four hours into the cooling process;
however, such foods should be discarded if the food is above 41 ºF and more than four
hours into the cooling process.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
608
 








(8)	 Assessing Personal Hygiene, Hands As a Vehicle of Contamination, and
Proper Implementation of Employee Health Policies
Special attention should be given to the potential for hands as a vehicle of
contamination. An effective management system for prevention of hand contamination
involves three elements:
•	 Employee health policy
•	 Proper handwashing
•	 No bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods.
There are a wide range of communicable diseases and infections that can be
transmitted by an infected food employee. Proper management of the risks associated
with ill food employees begins with employing healthy people and implementing a policy
that excludes or restricts ill employees as specified in Chapter 2 of the Food Code.
Employees must be aware of the symptoms, illnesses, or conditions that must be
reported to the person in charge. In addition, the person in charge must be
knowledgeable regarding the appropriate action to take should certain symptoms,
illnesses, or conditions be reported.
With regard to the employee health policy, inspectors should ask a series of openended questions to ascertain whether the employee health policy in place complies with
the Food Code. The following are example questions that may be asked:
•	 What kind of policy do you have in place for handling sick employees?
•	 Is there a written policy? (Note: a written policy is not required in the Food
Code, but having a written policy may give an indication of the formality of the
policy being discussed.)
•	 Describe how managers and food employees are made knowledgeable about
their duties and responsibilities under the employee health policy.
•	 Are food employees asked if they are experiencing certain symptoms or
illnesses upon conditional offer of employment? If so, what symptoms or
illnesses are food employees asked about? Is there a written record of this
inquiry?
•	 What are food employees instructed to do when they are sick?
•	 What conditions or symptoms are reported?
•	 What may some indicators be of someone who is working while ill?
•	 When are employees restricted from working with exposed food or foodcontact surfaces? When are they excluded from working in the food
establishment?
•	 For employees that are sick and cannot come to work, what policy is in place
for allowing them to return and for notifying the regulatory authority?
Special attention should be given to the potential for hands as a vehicle of
contamination. Ensuring that hands are washed using the proper procedure and at the
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
609
 














appropriate times must be a top priority during every inspection. Data show that viruses
can be tenacious even in the presence of good handwashing. Inspectors should
observe employee use of utensils and gloves during the preparation and service of
ready-to-eat foods and ingredients, such as salads and sandwiches.
If ready-to-eat food is touched with bare hands, inspectors will need to address several
questions in order to make the appropriate on-site correction recommendation. The
answers to the following questions should provide enough information to determine the
likelihood of occurrence of hazards transmitted by bare hands and should be the basis
for making a recommendation for on-site correction:
•	 Does the facility have an employee health policy to identify, restrict, and
exclude ill employees?
•	 Did the employees working with the food in question effectively wash their
hands and are handwashing facilities adequate?
•	 Is there an approved, alternate procedure to no bare hand contact in place
and was it followed before the bare hand contact?
•	 Has there been an opportunity for the employee’s hands to become
contaminated?
Inspectors should examine the location of handwashing sinks in relation to where food
is being prepared. Many jurisdictions use a basic distance measurement as a guideline
when considering the location and number of handwashing sinks required in a food
establishment during the plan review process. While this information can be used to
assist with the review process, it should not be used as the sole basis for determining
whether there are an adequate number of handwashing sinks or whether the
handwashing sinks are conveniently located.
Special emphasis should be placed on spacing in and around fixed equipment, the
expected staffing, and the flow of food throughout a food establishment. For instance, a
kitchen may be 30 feet in length and 12 feet wide. Although the size of the kitchen may
dictate only one handwashing sink using a basic distance measurement, if a prep table
the length of the line is placed between the line and the handwashing sink, the
handwashing sink may not be conveniently located. Likewise, one handwashing sink
located at the end of cook line is useless to employees working at the other end if there
is limited space for employees to go around one another during busy periods.
(9)	 Assessing Compliance with Approved Procedures
When conducting certain specialized processes, variances and HACCP plans are
required by the Code. This is because such processes carry a considerable risk if not
conducted under strict controls. For food establishments conducting specialized
processes, each inspection should involve a review of the written variance, if applicable,
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
610
 

















and the implementation of the HACCP plan to ensure that food safety hazards are being
consistently controlled.
(10) Assessing Special Requirements Related to Highly Susceptible
Populations (HSP)
Food establishments that serve highly susceptible populations (HSP) must adhere to
additional requirements as specified under Part 3-8 of the Code. Every effort should be
made to inspect such facilities during preparation, service, or other applicable times to
assess these additional requirements as well as those in other sections of the Food
Code.
Because those persons who are very young, elderly, or who live in a facility that
provides custodial care are extremely vulnerable to foodborne illness because of age or
health status, it is important that risk factors be controlled on-site in a timely manner.
Inspections of HSP facilities should be conducted by inspectors knowledgeable in the
control of foodborne illness risk factors who take extra care to assure that the most
vulnerable segment of the population are not at risk.
(11) Assessing Labeling, Storage, and Use of Poisonous and Toxic

Chemicals

During each inspection, the proper labeling, storage, and use of poisonous and toxic
chemicals should be verified. Containers of poisonous or toxic materials and personal
care items shall bear a legible manufacturer's label. Working containers used for
storing poisonous or toxic materials such as cleaners and sanitizers taken from bulk
supplies should be clearly and individually identified with the common name of the
material. Only chemicals that are necessary to the operation and maintenance of a
food establishment, such as for the cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and utensils
and the control of insects and rodents, should be in the food establishment. Medicines
necessary for the health of employees may be allowed in a food establishment, but they
should be labeled and stored to prevent contamination of food and food-contact
surfaces.
Inspectors should verify that solutions containing poisonous and toxic chemicals, like
mop water, are discarded in an appropriate service sink to prevent contamination of
food and food-contact surfaces. In addition, inspectors should check delivery trucks to
verify that food is protected from chemical contamination during shipment. Any food
that has been cross-contaminated with poisonous or toxic chemicals should be
discarded or rejected immediately.
(12) Assessing Compliance with Consumer Advisory
Inspectors should ascertain whether animal foods such as beef, eggs, fish, lamb, milk,
pork, poultry, or shellfish are served or sold raw, undercooked, or without otherwise
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
611
 















being processed to eliminate pathogens, either in ready-to-eat form or as an ingredient
in another ready-to-eat food. Inspectors should review the menu or food list to verify
that a consumer advisory with a disclosure and reminder is present as specified under
§ 3-603.11 of the Food Code.
In addition to reviewing the menu or food list, inspectors should ask whether raw or
undercooked foods are served or sold routinely or seasonally. It is useful to know foods
that are often served in this manner such as oysters-on-the half shell, hollandaise
sauce, béarnaise sauce, eggnog, salad dressings, hamburgers to order, or sunny-sideup eggs.
H.	 Evaluating Basic Sanitation and Facilities (Good Retail Practices)
An important part of a risk-based, routine inspection is to review how the food
establishment actively monitors the active managerial control of foodborne illness risk
factors and interventions; however, overall sanitation should not be overlooked.
Systems to control basic operational and sanitation conditions within a food
establishment, referred to as Good Retail Practices (GRPs), are the foundation of a
successful food safety management system. GRPs found to be out-of-compliance may
give rise to conditions that may lead to foodborne illness, e.g., sewage backing up in the
kitchen. Just as monitoring is required by the food establishment to ensure that
foodborne illness risk factors are controlled and interventions are in place, monitoring of
basic sanitation conditions in the food establishment allows the operator an excellent
opportunity to detect weaknesses and initiate actions for improvement. Basic
operational and sanitation programs must be in place to:
•	 Protect products from contamination by biological, chemical, and physical
food safety hazards
•	 Control bacterial growth that can result from temperature abuse during
storage
•	 Maintain equipment, especially equipment used to maintain product
temperatures.
Examples of concerns addressed by the basic operation and sanitation programs
mentioned above include the following:
•	 Pest control
•	 Food protection (CORE ITEM)
•	 Equipment maintenance
•	 Water
•	 Plumbing
•	 Toilet facilities
•	 Sewage
•	 Garbage and refuse disposal
•	 Physical facilities.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
612
 
















5. ACHIEVING ON-SITE AND LONG-TERM COMPLIANCE
A. Developing an Effective Compliance and Enforcement Protocol
Compliance and enforcement are essential elements of a regulatory program and
encompass all voluntary and regulatory enforcement actions taken to achieve
compliance with regulations. Standards 3 and 6 of the Program Standards explain the
need of regulatory jurisdictions to establish a compliance and enforcement protocol that
results in credible follow-up for each violation noted during an inspection, especially
violations related to foodborne illness risk factors and Food Code interventions. Lack of
follow-up on the part of the regulatory agency signals to the operator that the priority
item and priority foundation item violations noted were not important.
The resolution of out-of-compliance foodborne illness risk factors and Food Code
interventions must be documented in each food establishment record. The desired
outcome of Standard 6 is an effective compliance and enforcement program that is
implemented consistently to achieve compliance with regulatory requirements.
Compliance and enforcement options may vary depending on state and local law. It is
essential that regulatory jurisdictions develop a written compliance and enforcement
protocol that details the order in which both voluntary corrections may be taken on the
part of the operator and involuntary enforcement actions are to be taken on the part of
the regulatory authority. Involuntary enforcement actions include, but are not limited to,
such activities as warning letters, re-inspections, citations, administrative fines, permit
suspensions, and hearings.
Food establishment with a history of noncompliance at a level predetermined by the
jurisdiction or with the number of foodborne illness risk factors and interventions violated
warranting a regulatory action, signals the need either a strong regulatory response or
an alternate approach to compliance to protect public health, e.g., active managerial
control, behavioral change.
Voluntary corrections taken on the part of the operator include, but are not limited to,
such activities as on-site corrections at the time of inspection, voluntary destruction, risk
control plans, and remedial training. Obtaining voluntary corrections by the operator
can be very effective in achieving long-term compliance. Voluntary corrections by the
operator are referred to in FDA’s Regulator’s Manual as “intervention strategies.”
Intervention strategies can be divided into two groups:
• Those designed to achieve immediate on-site correction
• Those designed to achieve long-term compliance.
Successful intervention strategies for out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors can be
tailored to each operation’s resources and needs. This will require inspectors to work
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
613
 















with the operator to identify weaknesses in the existing food safety management system
and consulting with the operator to strengthen any weak areas noted.
B.	 On-site Correction
On-site corrections are intended to achieve immediate corrective action of out-of-control
foodborne illness risk factors posing an immediate, serious danger to the consumer
during the inspection. Usually these violations are "operational" rather than structural
and can be addressed by management at the time of the inspection.
It is essential to consumer protection and to regulatory credibility for on-site
correction to be obtained for any out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors
before completing the inspection and leaving the food establishment. Obtaining
on-site correction conveys the seriousness of the violation to management. Failure to
require on-site correction when an out-of-control risk factor has been identified implies
that the risk factor has little importance to food safety.
When recommending on-site correction, effective communication regarding out-ofcontrol foodborne illness risk factors is essential and can be accomplished best by:
•	 Discussing food safety concerns in words that can be easily understood by
the person in charge and employees
•	 Conveying the seriousness of the out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors
in terms of increased risk of illness or injury.
During the discussion of inspection findings with the person in charge, inspectors should
keep the discussion focused on correction of violations that present an immediate
danger to the consumer. Discussion of less serious code violations should be deferred
until out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors are discussed and on-site correction is
obtained.
In most cases, selecting the most appropriate on-site correction when out-of-control
foodborne illness risk factors are observed will be straightforward; however, in instances
such as improper cooling, the appropriate corrective action may be more complicated.
Since determining on-site correction depends on a number of factors, an inspector may
need to conduct a hazard analysis of the food in order to determine the appropriate
course of action to take.
C.	 Intervention Strategies for Achieving Long-term Compliance
While on-site correction of out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors is essential to
consumer protection, achieving long-term compliance and behavior change is equally
important. Overcoming several misconceptions about long-term compliance will help in
achieving a desirable change of behavior. For example, in jurisdictions using a 44-item
inspection report in which only observed violations are marked, it is often taken for
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
614
 





















granted that if there are no violations marked, the foodborne illness risk factors are
being controlled. This is not necessarily true since the observation of code violations is
subject to many variables such as the time of day, day of the week, or duration of the
inspection. An inspection system that records only observed violations rather than the
actual status of all foodborne illness risk factors, such as whether the risk factor was in
compliance, not observed, or not applicable to the operation, may be unable to detect
some foodborne illness risk factors that are continually or cyclically out of control.
Another misconception is that training alone will result in foodborne illness risk factors
being controlled. While training may help, there is no guarantee that knowledge
acquired will equate to knowledge applied in the workplace. In order for knowledge to
translate into changed behavior, it must be reinforced and the behavior must be
repeated for a period of time sufficient for the behavior to become an ingrained pattern.
Another assumption is that regulatory enforcement actions such as citations or
administrative hearings or on-site corrections alone will automatically result in future
management control. Unfortunately, there is no assurance that any of these actions will
result in the long-term control of foodborne illness risk factors.
Long-term compliance may best be achieved through voluntary actions by the operator.
If an operator supports the concept that a food safety management system is needed,
there is a better chance that long-term compliance will be achieved. The following are
ways operators can better ensure long-term active managerial control of foodborne
illness risk factors.
(1)	 Change Equipment and Layout
Critical limits are difficult to achieve when equipment does not work properly. Proper
calibration of equipment is vital to achieving food safety. When calibration is
unsuccessful or is not feasible, equipment should be replaced. In addition to equipment
malfunctioning, poor equipment layout can present opportunities for cross
contamination and must be considered. For example:
•	 Hamburgers with uniform thickness and weight are not all reaching a safe
cooking temperature in a given time. Upon examination, it is determined that
the grill is distributing heat unevenly. A new element is installed to correct the
problem.
•	 Splash from a nearby handwashing sink is seen on a prep table. A splash
guard is installed to prevent cross contamination from the handwashing sink
to the prep table.
(2)	 Establish Buyer Specifications
Written specifications for the goods and services purchased by a food establishment
prevent many problems. For example:
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
615
 
















•	 Fish posing a parasite hazard and intended for raw consumption have not
been frozen for the specified time and temperature and no freezing
equipment is on-site at the food establishment. Buyer specifications are
established to place the responsibility for freezing the fish on the supplier.
•	 Lobster tails, hamburgers, or other products cooked with a set time parameter
on a conveyor are not reaching the proper temperature in the specified time
because they are larger than the size for which the conveyor is calibrated.
Buyer specifications are established to restrict the size of products received
from the supplier.
(3)	 Develop and Implement Recipe/Process Instructions
Simple control measures integrated into recipes and processes can improve
management control over foodborne illness risk factors. For example:
•	 Process instructions that specify using color-coded cutting boards for
separating raw animal foods from ready-to-eat products are developed to
control the potential for cross contamination.
•	 Pasteurized eggs are substituted in recipes that call for raw or undercooked
eggs to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.
•	 Commercially precooked chicken is used in recipes calling for cooked chicken
such as chicken salad to reduce the risk of contaminating food-contact
surfaces and ready-to-eat food with raw chicken.
•	 Pasta is chilled in an ice bath immediately after cooking and before
apportioning into single servings. This is specified in the procedures for
cooking spaghetti.
(4)	 Establish First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Procedures
Product rotation is important for both quality and safety reasons. “First-In-First-Out”
(FIFO) means that the first batch of product prepared and placed in storage should be
the first one sold or used. Date marking foods as required by the Food Code facilitates
the use of a FIFO procedure in refrigerated, ready-to-eat, TCS foods. The FIFO
concept limits the potential for pathogen growth, encourages product rotation, and
documents compliance with time/temperature requirements.
(5)	 Develop and Implement Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Following standardized, written procedures for performing various tasks ensures that
quality, efficiency, and safety criteria are met each time the task is performed. Although
every operation is unique, the following list contains some common management areas
that can be controlled with SOPs:
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
616
 










•	 Personnel (disease control, cleanliness, training)
•	 Facility maintenance
•	 Sanitary conditions (general cleaning schedule, chemical storage, pest
control, sanitization of food-contact surfaces)
•	 Sanitary facilities (approved water supply and testing, if applicable, scheduled
in-house inspection of plumbing, sewage disposal, handwashing and toilet
facilities, trash removal)
•	 Equipment and utensil maintenance.
SOPs can also be developed to detail procedures for controlling foodborne illness risk
factors:
•	 Procedures are implemented for measuring temperatures at a given
frequency and for taking appropriate corrective actions to prevent hazards
associated inadequate cooking.
•	 Adequate handwashing is achieved by following written procedures that
dictate frequency, proper technique, and monitoring.
(6)	 Develop and Implement Risk Control Plans (RCPs)
An RCP is a concisely written management plan developed by the retail or food service
operator with input from inspectors that describes a management system for controlling
specific out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors. An RCP is intended to be a
voluntary strategy that inspectors and the person in charge jointly develop to promote
long-term compliance for specific out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors. For
example, if food is improperly cooled in the establishment, a system of monitoring and
record keeping outlined in an RCP can ensure that new procedures are established to
adequately cool the food in the future. An RCP should require that the basic control
systems in the plan be implemented for a designated period of time (e.g., 60 – 90 days)
and allow inspector oversight. The longer the plan is implemented, the more likely it is
that the new controls will become "habits" that continue to be used in the food
establishment after inspector oversight ends.
An RCP should stress simple control measures that can be integrated into the daily
routine. It should be brief, no more than one page for each risk factor, and address the
following points in very specific terms:
•	 What is the risk factor to be controlled?
•	 How is the risk factor controlled?
•	 Who is responsible for the control?
•	 What monitoring and record keeping is required?
•	 Who is responsible for monitoring and completing records?
•	 What corrective actions should be taken when deviations are noted?
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
617
 



















•	 How long is the plan to continue?
•	 How are the results of the RCP communicated to inspectors?
By implementing an RCP, the retail or food service operator will have the opportunity to
determine the appropriate corrective action for the identified problem and design an
implementation strategy to best suit the establishment and operation. Since the RCP is
tailored to meet the needs of the food establishment, the operator takes complete
ownership of the plan and is ultimately responsible for its development and
implementation. The role of inspectors are to consult with the operator by suggesting
ways that the risk factor(s) might be controlled.
By creating an RCP, the operator realizes that a problem exists in the established food
safety management system and commits to a specific correction plan rather than merely
acknowledging a single violation. Follow up by telephone or in person indicates to the
operator that inspectors are interested in seeing the plan succeed. This also gives
inspectors an opportunity to answer any questions and offer feedback to the operator to
make the RCP more useful. An example of an RCP, along with a blank template that
can be used by regulatory jurisdictions, is found in FDA’s Regulator’s Manual:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006812.htm
(7)	 Develop and Implement Comprehensive Voluntary Food Safety

Management Systems based on HACCP Principles

The Food Code only requires HACCP plans for a few specialized processes; however,
the development of voluntary HACCP plans is always encouraged. FDA Operator’s
Manual, "Managing Food Safety: A Manual for the Voluntary Use of HACCP Principles
for Operators of Food Service and Retail Establishments" is written to aid food
establishment managers in the development of food safety management systems based
on HACCP principles. A retail or food service operator, in consultation with an
appropriate regulatory authority or other food safety professional, can use this
document to establish an effective food safety management system to control for all
foodborne illness risk factors. This document is available from FDA through the
following website:
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ucm2006811.htm
6.	 INSPECTION FORM AND SCORING
A.	 The Inspection Form
The inspection form is the official document utilized by a regulatory agency for
documentation of compliance of the food establishment with regulatory requirements.
The goal of the inspection form is to clearly, concisely, and fairly present the compliance
status of the food establishment and to convey compliance information to the permit
holder or person in charge at the conclusion of the inspection.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
618
 
















The inspection report should be kept in the food establishment's files for subsequent
compliance actions and review before the next inspection. Individual inspection reports
are to be made available for public review in accordance with Freedom of Information
criteria.
Annex 7 of the Food Code provides an inspection form that may be completed for
routine, follow-up, and compliance inspections. This inspection form meets
requirements established in Standards 3 and 6 of the Program Standards.
B. Debiting Methodology
If a violation exists during an inspection, it should always be marked on the inspection
report, even if corrected on site. Violations existing at the time of the inspection
probably would have persisted if it were not for the inspection. Slight violations, such as
one dirty utensil among hundreds of clean utensils, does not indicate that the food
establishment is significantly deviating from the Code requirements; therefore,
discretion in marking is required.
It is very important to investigate the root causes of violations and mark them
appropriately. Without taking this extra step, inspectors will merely point out violations
and will not identify weaknesses in the management system in place. If long-term
control of the behaviors or practices leading to the violations is expected, inspectors
must identify the causes.
C. Scoring
Regulatory agencies may use scoring methods to rate food establishments. Depending
on the system used, establishment scoring may provide an indication of how well a food
establishment is complying with the food safety rules of the regulatory agency.
Some agencies use a system of compliance tools as provided in Chapter 8 and Annex 1
of the Food Code to protect public health. The inspection score may serve as the basis
for triggering follow-up inspections or other forms of regulatory sanctions when they fall
too far from the accepted levels. In addition, scoring may provide a mechanism for
consumers to make informed choices regarding where they want to eat.
Use of scoring systems also has negative consequences. For example, it is possible for
a food establishment to receive a high numerical or letter score while exhibiting some
very serious deficiencies. In recognition of this drawback, some jurisdictions forego
scoring systems in favor of demerits or debit systems without assigning a final score.
This focuses attention on the items needing correction. Compliance and enforcement
decisions can still be based on the increasing levels of identified deficiencies. Whatever
method or system of establishment rating is used, policies regarding follow-up and
enforcement actions should be established in writing, linked to the rating system, and
administered consistently.
Annex 5 – Conducting Risk-based Inspections
619
 















7. CLOSING CONFERENCE
The closing conference should include a detailed discussion of the food establishment's
plans for correcting violations found during the inspection. The evidence collected or
observed during the inspection and the alternatives available for compliance should be
emphasized. On-site corrections made during the inspection should be acknowledged
on the inspection report and in the closing conference.
The compliance plan should address changes in procedures that will prevent the
recurrence of noted violations. The food establishment's compliance plans should be
formally documented on the inspection report form. Follow-up letters may be necessary
to elicit fulfillment of these agreements. It is important to stress to the operator that
long-term correction of violations related to foodborne illness risk factors and Food
Code interventions is far more important than corrections of core items.
8. SUMMARY
Although a retail and food service operator has the responsibility for establishing a food
safety management system for controlling foodborne illness risk factors, inspectors
have a vital, multi-faceted role in consumer protection. It is essential that inspectors are
provided with the proper training, equipment, time, and resources to adequately perform
their jobs.
The primary role of inspectors is to ensure that the operator has effective control of
foodborne illness risk factors. Once inspectors have established a dialogue with the
person in charge and employees, conducted a menu/food list review, and established a
dialogue with the person in charge, inspectors will have enough information to mentally
place menu items into one of the three process flows. The inspection can then focus on
assessing the operator’s active managerial control of foodborne illness risk factors
associated with each process.
Once out-of-control foodborne illness risk factors are identified, the role of inspectors
shifts to assisting the operator with strengthening the existing food safety management
system through intervention strategies designed to achieve immediate and long-term
compliance. With inspector’s assistance, a retail and food service operator can achieve
long-term behavioral change resulting in a reduction in risk factor occurrence and an
increase in public health protection.

Annex
6 Food Processing
Criteria

1. INTRODUCTION
2. REDUCED OXYGEN PACKAGING
3. SMOKING AND CURING
1. INTRODUCTION
From its inception, the retail segment of the food industry has prepared foods in
consumer-sized portions, using commercially available equipment for cutting, grinding,
slicing, cooking, and refrigeration, and applying herbs and spices readily available to
consumers at their local grocery.
Over the past score of years, retail segment operators have expanded into food
manufacturing/processing-type operations, often using sophisticated new technologies
and equipment that are sometimes microprocessor-controlled. Many now desire to
alter the atmospheres within food packages, or apply federally regulated chemical food
additives as a method of food preservation. Food processing operations now being
conducted or proposed include cook-chill; vacuum packaging; sous vide; smoking and
curing; brewing, processing, and bottling alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages,
or drinking water; and custom processing of animals.
The Food Code specifies that a HACCP plan acceptable to the regulatory authority be
the basis for approving food manufacturing/processing operations at retail. The
HACCP plans are to be provided and accepted in two ways as follows.
(A) Reduced Oxygen Packaging
Section 3-502.12 of the Food Code provides the criteria that are to be met in the
HACCP plans of those operators who are conducting reduced oxygen packaging (ROP)
operations. Unless prior approval of the HACCP plan is required by the regulatory
authority, the HACCP plan covering this operation along with the related records
documenting monitoring and corrective actions need only be available and acceptable
to the regulatory authority at the time of inspection.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
621
 






(B) Other Food Manufacturing/Processing Operations
Except for ROP as discussed in (A) above, the Food Code specifies under §§ 3-502.11,
8-103.10, 8-103.11, and 8-201.13 that the food establishment operator must obtain a
variance from the regulatory authority for all food manufacturing/processing operations
based on the prior approval of a HACCP plan.
The purpose of this Annex is to provide processing criteria for different types of food
manufacturing/processing operations for use by those preparing and reviewing HACCP
plans and proposals. Criteria for additional processes will be provided as they are
developed, reviewed, and accepted.
2. REDUCED OXYGEN PACKAGING
(A) Introduction
ROP which provides an environment that contains little or no oxygen, offers unique
advantages and opportunities for the food industry but also raises many microbiological
concerns. Products packaged using ROP may be produced safely if proper controls
are in effect. Producing and distributing these products with a HACCP approach offer
an effective, rational, and systematic method for the assurance of food safety. Nontime/temperature control for safety food, defined in Chapter 1, does not require a
variance or HACCP Plan for ROP. This Annex will provide guidelines for effective food
safety controls for retail food establishments covering the receipt, processing,
packaging, holding, displaying, and labeling of food in reduced oxygen packages.
(B) Definitions
The term ROP can be used to describe any packaging procedure that results in a
reduced oxygen level in a sealed package. The term is often used because it is an
inclusive term and can include packaging options such as:
(1) Cook-chill packaging, in which cooked food is hot filled into impermeable
bags which have the air expelled and are then sealed or crimped closed. The
bagged food is rapidly chilled and refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the
growth of psychrotrophic pathogens.
(2) Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP) in which the atmosphere of a
package of food is modified so that until the package is opened, its composition
is different from air, and continuous control of that atmosphere is maintained,
such as by using oxygen scavengers or a combination of total replacement of
oxygen, nonrespiring food, and impermeable packaging material.
(3) Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) in which the atmosphere of a
package of food is modified so that its composition is different from air but the
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
622
 





atmosphere may change over time due to the permeability of the packaging
material or the respiration of the food. Modified atmosphere packaging includes
reduction in the proportion of oxygen, total replacement of oxygen, or in increase
in the proportion of other gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen.
(4) Sous Vide , in which raw or partially cooked food is placed in a hermetically
sealed, impermeable bag, cooked in the bag, rapidly chilled, and refrigerated at
temperatures that inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens.
(5) Vacuum Packaging in which air is removed from the package of food and
the package is hermetically sealed so that a vacuum remains inside the
package.
(C) Benefits of ROP
ROP can create a significantly anaerobic environment that prevents the growth of
aerobic spoilage organisms, which generally are Gram-negative bacteria such as
pseudomonads or aerobic yeast and molds. These organisms are responsible for offodors, slime, and texture changes, which are signs of spoilage.
ROP can be used to prevent degradation or oxidative processes in food products.
Reducing the oxygen in and around a food retards the amount of oxidative rancidity in
fats and oils. ROP also prevents color deterioration in raw meats caused by oxygen.
An additional effect of sealing food in ROP is the reduction of product shrinkage by
preventing water loss.
These benefits of ROP allow an extended shelf life for vacuum packaged (VP),
modified atmosphere packaged (MAP) and controlled atmosphere packaged (CAP)
foods displayed for retail sale. Cook chill (CC) and sous vide (SV) processed food
cannot be sold directly to consumers or other businesses but the extended shelf life
and quality benefits internal service and use of the products. Providing an extended
shelf life for ready-to-eat convenience foods and advertising foods as "Fresh – Never
Frozen" are examples of economic and quality advantages.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
623
 







(D) Safety Concerns
Use of ROP with some foods can markedly increase safety concerns. Unless
time/temperature control for safety foods are protected inherently, simply placing them
in ROP without regard to microbial growth will increase the risk of foodborne illnesses.
ROP processors and regulators must assure that during distribution of foods or while
foods are held by retailers or consumers, refrigerated temperatures must be
consistently maintained. In fact, a serious concern is that the increased use of vacuum
packaging at retail supermarket deli-type operations may be followed by temperature
abuse in the establishment or by the consumer. Consequently, at least one barrier or
multiple hurdles resulting in a barrier needs to be incorporated into the production
process for products packaged using ROP. The incorporation of several sub-inhibitory
barriers, none of which could individually inhibit microbial growth but which in
combination provide a full barrier to growth (the hurdle concept), is necessary to ensure
food safety.
Some products in ROP contain no preservatives and frequently do not possess any
intrinsic inhibitory barriers (such as, pH, aw, or salt concentrations) that either alone or
in combination will inhibit microbial growth. Thus, product safety is not provided by
natural or formulated characteristics.
A reduced oxygen atmosphere provides the potential for growth of several important
foodborne pathogens. Some of these pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes
are psychrotrophic and grow slowly at temperatures near the freezing point of foods.
Additionally, the inhibition of the spoilage bacteria is significant because without these
competing organisms, tell-tale signs signaling that the product is no longer fit for
consumption will not occur.
The use of one form of ROP, vacuum packaging, is not new. Many food products have
a long and safe history of being vacuum packaged in ROP. However, the early use of
vacuum packaging for smoked fish had disastrous results, causing a long-standing
moratorium on certain uses of this technology at the retail level.
(1) Refrigerated Holding Requirements for Foods in ROP
Safe use of ROP technology demands that adequate refrigeration be maintained during
the entire shelf-life of time/temperature control for safety foods to ensure product
safety.
Bacteria, with the exception of those that can form spores, are eliminated by
pasteurization. However, pathogens may survive in the final product if pasteurization is
inadequate, poor quality raw materials or poor handling practices are used, or postprocessing contamination occurs. Even if foods that are in ROP receive adequate
thermal processing, a particular concern is present at retail when employees open
manufactured products and repackage them. This operation presents the potential for
post-processing contamination by pathogens.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
624
 







If products in ROP are subjected to mild temperature abuse, i.e., 5o
-12o
C (41o
-53o
F), at
any stage during storage or distribution, foodborne pathogens, including Bacillus
cereus, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
can grow slowly. Marginal refrigeration that does not facilitate growth may still allow
Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Brucella spp. to survive for long periods of
time.
Published surveys indicate that refrigeration practices at retail need improvement.
Some refrigerated products offered in convenience stores were found at or above 7.2o
C
(45o
F) 50% of the time; in several cases temperatures as high as 10o
C (50o
F) were
observed. Delicatessen display cases have been shown to demonstrate poor
temperature control. Foods have been observed above 10o
C (50o
F) and above 12.8o
C
(55o
F) in several instances. Supermarket fresh meat cases appear to have a relatively
good record of temperature control. However, even these foods can occasionally be
found above 10o
C (50o
F).
Temperature abuse is common throughout distribution and retail markets. Strict
adherence to temperature control and shelf-life must be observed and documented by
the establishment using ROP. Buyer specifications for refrigerated distribution systems
as well as internal time/temperature controls should be implemented by the
establishment. Information on temperature control should also be provided to the
consumer. Currently these controls are not extensively used.
(2)	 Control of Clostridium botulinum and Listeria monocytogenes in
Reduced Oxygen Packaged Foods
There has been an increased interest in ROP at retail using conventional refrigeration
units for holding. Refrigerated foods packaged at retail may be chilled either after they
are physically prepared and repackaged, or packaged after a cooking step. In either
case Clostridium botulinum and Listeria monocytogenes are the pathogens of
concern for ROP products.
Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism, a severe food poisoning
characterized by double vision, paralysis, and occasionally death. The organism is an
anaerobic spore-forming bacteria that produces a potent neurotoxin. The spores are
ubiquitous in nature, relatively heat-resistant, and can survive most minimal heat
treatments that destroy vegetative cells. Certain strains of C. botulinum (type E and
non-proteolytic types B and F), which have been primarily associated with fish, are
psychrotrophic and can grow and produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3o
C (38o
F).
Other strains of C. botulinum (type A and proteolytic types B and F) can grow and
produce toxin at temperatures slightly above 10o
C (50o
F). If present, C. botulinum
could potentially grow and render a food PACKAGED and held in ROP toxigenic because
most other competing organisms are inhibited by ROP. Therefore, the food could be
toxic yet appear organoleptically acceptable.
This is particularly true of psychrotrophic strains of C. botulinum that do not produce
tell-tale proteolytic enzymes which result in a distinct bad odor. Because botulism is
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
625
 


potentially deadly, foods held in anaerobic conditions merit regulatory concern and
vigilance.
The potential for Clostridium botulinum toxin to develop also exists when ROP is
used after heat treatments such as pasteurization, or sous vide processing of foods
which will not destroy the spores of C. botulinum. Mild heat treatments (heat shocks)
in combination with ROP may actually select for C. botulinum by killing off competitors.
If the applied heat treatment does not produce commercial sterility, the food requires
refrigeration below 3.3o
C (38o
F) to prevent spore germination and toxin formation and
ensure product safety. For this reason, sous vide products are frequently frozen and
held in frozen storage until use.
There is a further microbial concern with ROP at retail. Processed products such as
meats and cheeses which have undergone an adequate cooking step to kill
L. monocytogenes can be re-contaminated when opened, sliced, and repackaged at
retail. Thus, a simple packaging or repackaging operation can present an opportunity
for recontamination with pathogens if strict sanitary safeguards are not in place. Hard
and semi-soft cheeses that meet the Standards of Identity for those cheeses in 21 CFR
133.150 Hard cheeses, 21 CFR 133.169 Pasteurized process cheese and 21 CFR
133.187 Semi-soft cheeses may be packaged using ROP without a variance. Refer to
Annex 3 Public Health Reasons, Sections 3-501.17 and 3-501.18 for a partial list of
hard and semi-soft cheeses.
Processors of products using ROP should build in extra safeguards if they plan to rely
on refrigeration as the sole barrier that ensures product safety. This approach requires
very rigorous temperature controls of products and refrigeration equipment. If extended
shelf life is sought, a temperature of 3.3o
C (38o
F) or lower must be maintained at all
times to prevent outgrowth of C. botulinum and the subsequent production of toxin.
Listeria monocytogenes can grow at even lower temperatures; consequently,
appropriate use-by dates must be established. Growth barriers are provided by hurdles
such as low pH, aw, or short shelf life, and constant monitoring of the product
temperature. Any one hurdle, or a combination of several, may be used with
refrigeration to control pathogenic outgrowth.
(3) Design of Heat Processes for Foods in Reduced Oxygen Packages
Heat processes for sous vide or cook-chill operations must be designed so that, at a
minimum, all vegetative pathogens are destroyed by a pasteurization process and
temperature control is verified. When temperature is the only barrier and no other
intrinsic or extrinsic factors add protection against the growth of foodborne pathogens
and formation of toxin, the product may not be sold to other business entities or to the
consumer in the ROP package because of the inability to verify temperature control.
The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF),
chartered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS), commented on the microbial safety of refrigerated foods
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
626
 






Finally, if foods are held long enough, even under proper refrigeration, extended shelf
life may be a problem. A study on fresh vegetables inoculated with
L. monocytogenes, conducted to determine the effect of MAP on shelf life, found that
MAP lengthened the time that all vegetables were considered acceptable, but that
populations of L. monocytogenes increased during that extended storage.
containing cooked, uncured meat or poultry products that are packaged for extended
refrigerated shelf life and are ready-to-eat or prepared with little or no additional heat
treatment. NACMCF recommended guidelines for evaluating the ability of thermal
processes to inactivate L. monocytogenes in extended shelf life refrigerated foods.
Specifically, it recommended a proposed requirement for demonstrating that an ROP
process provides a heat treatment sufficient to achieve a 4 decimal log reduction (4D)
of L. monocytogenes.
Other scientific reports recommend more extensive thermal processing. Thermal
processes for sous vide practiced in Europe are designed to achieve a 12-13 log
reduction (12-13D) of the target organism Streptococcus faecalis. It is reasoned that
thermal inactivation of this organism would ensure destruction of all other vegetative
pathogens.
Food manufacturers with adequate in-house research and development programs may
have the ability to design their own thermal processes. However, small retailers and
supermarkets may not be able to perform the microbiological challenge studies
necessary to provide the same level of food safety. If a retail establishment wishes to
use an ROP process with different time-temperature parameters from those provided in
Section 3-502.12 of the Food Code, microbiological inoculation studies should be
performed by, or in conjunction with, an appropriate process authority or person
knowledgeable in food microbiology who is acceptable to the regulatory authority.
(4)	 Consumer Handling Practices and In-Home Refrigerator

Temperatures

Extended shelf life provided by ROP is cause for concern because of the potential for
abuse by the consumer. Consumers often cannot, or do not, maintain adequate
refrigeration of time/temperature control for safety foods at home. Under the best of
circumstances, home refrigerators can be expected to range between 5o and 10o
C (41o
­
50o
F). One study reported that home refrigerator temperatures in 21% of the
households surveyed were 10o
C (50o
F). Another study reported more than 1 of 4 home
refrigerators are above 7.2o
C (45o
F) and almost 1 of 10 are above 10o
C (50o
F). Thus,
refrigeration alone cannot be relied on for ensuring microbiological safety after foods in
ROP leave the establishment.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
627
 






Consumers have come to expect that certain packages of foods would be safe without
refrigeration. Low-acid canned foods have been thermally processed, which renders
the food shelf-stable. Retort heating ensures the destruction of C. botulinum spores
as well as all other foodborne pathogens. Yet consumers may not understand that
most products that are packaged in ROP are not commercially sterile or shelf-stable
and must be refrigerated. A clear label statement to keep the product refrigerated must
be provided to consumers.
The use of ROP has been extensively studied by regulators and the food industry over
the past several years. Recommendations have been adapted from the Association of
Food and Drug Officials "Retail Guidelines - Refrigerated Foods in Reduced Oxygen
Packages" and New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets "Proposed
Reduced Oxygen Packaging Regulations." As provided in the Food Code, some ROP
operations may be conducted under provision 3-502.12 Reduced Oxygen Packaging,
Criteria. Food that is packaged by an ROP method under these provisions is
considered safe while it is under the control of the establishment and, if the labeling
instructions are followed, while under the control of the consumer.
(E) Safety Barrier Verification
The safety barriers for all ROP processed foods under a variance at retail must be
verified in writing. Independent laboratory analysis using methodology approved by the
regulatory authority such as official methods of the AOAC International (AOAC) can
also be used to verify incoming product. ROP processed foods which comply with one
of the methods in Section 3-502.12 do not require written verification.
Any changes in product formulation or processing procedures should be reflected in the
HACCP plan and may require further product testing for validation. A record of all safety
barrier verifications should be updated every 12 months. This record must be available to
the regulatory authority for review at the time of inspection.
(F) USDA Process Exemption
Meat and poultry products cured at a food processing plant regulated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture using substances specified in 9 CFR 424, Preparation and
Processing Operations, are exempt from the safety barrier verification requirements.
Other ROP operations may be developed that do not meet the provisions of Section
3-502.12 of the Code and that will require a variance and prior approval by the
regulatory authority under Section 3-502.11.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
628
 






(G) Recommendations for ROP Without Multiple Barriers
(1) Employee Training
If ROP is used in a food establishment, employees assigned to packaging of the foods
must have documented proof that demonstrates familiarity with ROP guidelines in this
Annex and the potential hazards associated with these foods. A description of the
training and course content provided to the employees must either be available for
review or have prior approval by the regulatory authority.
(2) Refrigeration Requirements
Refrigeration times and temperatures to inhibit C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes
must be based on laboratory inoculation study data or follow one of the ROP methods
in Section 3-502.12 which specifies the time and temperature combinations. The ROP
package must be marked with a use-by date within either the manufacturer's labeled
use-by date or as determined by the laboratory data, whichever comes first.
Alternatively, foods packaged by ROP may be kept frozen if freezing is used as the
declared primary safety barrier.
(3) Labeling - Refrigeration Statements
All foods offered for sale in ROP which rely on refrigeration at 5o
C (41o
F) or less as a
barrier to microbial growth must bear the statement "Important - Must be kept
refrigerated at 5o
C (41o
F)" or "Important - Must be kept frozen," in the case of foods
which rely on freezing as a primary safety barrier. The statement must appear on the
principal display panel in bold type on a contrasting background. Foods packaged using
cook chill or sous vide processing methods which have lower refrigeration requirements
below 5o
C (41o
F) as a condition of safe shelf life must be monitored for temperature
history and must not be offered for retail sale in the package or sold to a different
business entity. The labeling statement regarding cold holding temperatures is not
required for food packaged using cook chill or sous vide processing.
(4) Labeling - "Use-by date"
The shelf life of ROP foods is based on storage temperature for a certain time and
other intrinsic factors of the food (pH, aw, cured with salt and nitrite, high levels of
competing organisms, organic acids, natural antibiotics or bacteriocins, salt,
preservatives, etc.). Each package of food in ROP must bear a "use-by" date. In some
cases such as cook chill or sous vide processing when none of these intrinsic factors
are present, a temperature lower than 3ºC (38ºF) must be the controlling factor for C.
botulinum and L. monocytogenes growth and/or toxin formation. This “use by” date
cannot exceed the number of days specified in one of the ROP methods in Section 3
502.12 or must be based on laboratory inoculation studies. The date assigned by a
retail repacker cannot extend beyond the manufacturer's recommended expiration or
"pull date" for the food. The "use-by" date must be listed on the principal display panel
­
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
629
 




in bold type on a contrasting background for any product sold to consumers. Any label
on packages intended for consumer sale must contain a combination of a "sell-by" date
and use-by instructions which makes it clear that the product must be consumed within
the number of days determined to be safe as specified under Section 3-502.12 of the
Food Code. Foods, especially fish, that are frozen before or immediately after
packaging and remain frozen until use should bear a label statement, “Important, keep
frozen until used, thaw under refrigeration immediately before use.” Raw meat and
poultry packaged using ROP methods must be labeled with safe handling instructions
found in 9 CFR 317.2(l) and 9 CFR 381.125(b).
(H)	 Foods Which Require a Variance Under Code Section 3-502.11 if Packaged
in Reduced Oxygen Atmosphere
(1) Unfrozen processed fish and smoked fish may not be packed by ROP
unless retail food establishments have an approved variance application and
HACCP plan to show C. botulinum spore germination and toxin production or
L. monocytogenes growth will not occur and are inspected by the regulatory
authority. Establishments packaging such fish products, and smoking and
packing establishments, must be licensed in accordance with applicable law.
(2) Soft cheeses such as ricotta, cottage cheese, cheese spreads, and
combinations of cheese with other ingredients such as vegetables, meat, or fish
at retail must be approved for ROP through an approved variance application
and HACCP plan and be inspected by the regulatory authority.
(3) Meat or poultry products which are smoked or cured at retail, except that raw
food of animal origin which is cured in a USDA-regulated processing plant, or
establishment approved by the regulatory authority to cure these foods, may be
smoked in accordance with approved time/temperature requirements and
packaged in ROP at retail if approved by the regulatory authority. Smoking
which meets the time/temperature parameters in Section 3-401.11 does not
require a variance. Cold smoking where the temperature achieved by the
product is greater than 41ºF requires a variance. Curing using nitrite or nitrate
always requires a variance.
(I)	 Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Operation
All food establishments packaging food in a reduced oxygen atmosphere must develop
a HACCP plan and maintain the plan at the processing site for review by the regulatory
authority. For ROP operations, the plan must include the requirements specified under
¶ 8-201.14(D). In addition, the HACCP plan may also include:
(1) A complete description of the processing, packaging, and storage
procedures designated as critical control points, with attendant critical limits,
corrective action plans, monitoring and verification schemes, and records
required;
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
630
 





(2) A list of equipment and food-contact packaging supplies used, including
compliance standards that may be required by the regulatory authority, i.e., a
recognized third party equipment evaluation organization such as NSF
International;
(3) A description of the lot identification system;
(4) A description of the employee training program;
(5) A listing and proportion of food-grade gasses used; and
(6) A standard operating procedure for method and frequency of cleaning and
sanitizing food-contact surfaces in the designated processing area.
(J) Precautions Against Contamination at Retail
Only unopened packages of commercially processed, ready-to-eat deli meats or
cheeses obtained from sources that comply with the applicable laws relating to food
safety should be used for ROP packaging at retail. If it is necessary to stop packaging
for a period in excess of one-half hour, the remainder of that product should be diverted
for another use in the retail establishment. Cook chill products that are cooked before
packaging (ready-to-eat) should also be protected from cross-contamination before
being packaged.
(K) Disposition of Expired Product at Retail
Processed reduced oxygen foods that exceed the "use-by" date or manufacturer's "pull
date" cannot be sold in any form and must be disposed of in a proper manner.
(L) Dedicated Area/Restricted Access
All aspects of reduced oxygen packaging shall be conducted in an area specifically
designated for this purpose. There shall be an effective separation to prevent cross
contamination between raw and cooked foods. Access to processing equipment shall
be restricted to responsible trained personnel who are familiar with the potential
hazards inherent in food packaged by an ROP method. Some ROP procedures such
as sous vide may require a "sanitary zone" or dedicated room with restricted access to
prevent contamination.

3. SMOKING AND CURING
(A) Introduction
Meat and poultry are cured by the addition of salt alone or in combination with one or
more ingredients such as sodium nitrite, sugar, curing accelerators, and spices. These
are used for partial preservation, flavoring, color enhancement, tenderizing and
improving yield of meat. The process may include dry curing, immersion curing, direct
addition, or injection of the curing ingredients. Curing mixtures are typically composed
of salt (sodium chloride), sodium nitrite, and seasonings. The preparation of curing
mixtures must be carefully controlled. A number of proprietary mixtures which are
uniform in composition are available. The maximum residual sodium nitrite in the
finished product is limited to 200 ppm by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS). A sodium nitrite concentration of 120 ppm is usually sufficient for most
purposes. Specific requirements for added nitrite may be found in USDA regulations, 9
CFR 424. It is important to use curing methods which achieve uniform distribution of
the curing mixture in the meat or poultry product.
(B) Definitions
Cured meat and poultry can be divided into three basic categories: (1) uncomminuted
smoked products; (2) sausages; and (3) uncomminuted unsmoked processed meats.
(1) Uncomminuted smoked products - include bacon, beef jerky, hams, pork
shoulders, turkey breasts, turkey drumsticks.
(2) Sausages - include both finely ground and coarse ground products. Finely
ground sausages include bologna, frankfurters, luncheon meats and loaves,
sandwich spreads, and viennas. Coarse ground sausages include chorizos,
kielbasa, pepperoni, salami, and summer sausages.
(3) Cured sausages - may be categorized as: (1) raw, cured; (2) cooked,
smoked; (3) cooked, unsmoked; and (4) dry, semidry, or fermented.
(4) Uncomminuted, unsmoked processed products - include corned beef,
pastrami, pig's feet, corned tongues. This category of products may be sold as
either raw ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
634
 







(C) Incorporation of Cure Ingredients
Regardless of preparation method, cure ingredients must be distributed throughout the
product. Cure ingredients may be introduced into sausage products during mixing or
comminuting. Proper and thorough mixing is necessary whether the cure is added to
the formulation in dry or solution form. Muscle cuts may be cured by immersion into a
curing (pickle) solution. These methods depend on slow diffusion of the curing agents
through the product. Products must be properly refrigerated during immersion curing.
Several methods may be used to shorten curing times. These include hot immersion
curing greater than 49o
C (>120o
F), injection by arterial pumping (e.g., hams), and stitch
pumping by a series of hollow needles. If the injection method is used, injection
needles must be frequently monitored during processing to ensure that they are not
fouled or plugged.
Tumbling or massaging may also be used as an aid to hasten curing. Proper sanitation
must be observed to prevent contamination during this operation.
The dry curing method, a similar process, may also be used. In this case, curing
ingredients are rubbed over cuts and surfaces of meat held under refrigeration.
Precautions must include wearing sanitary gloves when meat is handled. Product
temperature maintenance is critical.
(D) Smoking
Smoking is the process of exposing meat products to wood smoke. Depending on the
method, some products may be cooked and smoked simultaneously, smoked and dried
without cooking, or cooked without smoking. Smoke may be produced by burning wood
chips or using an approved liquid smoke preparation. Liquid smoke preparations may
also be substituted for smoke by addition directly onto the product during formulation in
lieu of using a smokehouse or another type of smoking vessel. As with curing
operations, a standard operating procedure must be established to prevent
contamination during the smoking process.
(E) Fermentation and Dehydration
Meat may be fermented or dehydrated for preservation. The purpose of fermentation is
to reduce the pH to below 4.6 and inhibit bacteria harmful to health as well as bacteria
which can cause spoilage. Meat products may also be cured and then dehydrated to
prevent germination and growth of bacterial spores. Many fermented and dehydrated
meats are made without a cooking step. Sanitary practices in the production of these
products are extremely important because Staphylococcus aureus can be introduced.
Staphylococcus aureus produces an enterotoxin that is heat stable and thus will not
be inactivated by subsequent cooking.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
635
 





Processed pork products require treatment to destroy Trichinella spiralis. At retail,
products which contain raw pork and which are not subsequently cooked must be
produced from certified trichina-free pork or treated to destroy trichinae. USDA
regulations, 9 CFR 318.10(c)(3), establish various requirements for destroying trichina
in pork by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.
Some fermented and dry cured products are processed without cooking. The labeling
for these products should include instructions to the consumer to cook thoroughly
before consumption.
(F) Recommendations for Safe Curing of Meat and Poultry
(1) Posting of Acceptable Products
A list of products approved by the regulatory authority, or by an approved
knowledgeable authority on curing acceptable to the regulatory authority, must be
posted in the processing area of the establishment.
(2) Employee Training
Employees assigned to cure meat or poultry must demonstrate familiarity with these
guidelines and the potential hazards associated with curing foods. A description of the
training and course content provided to the employees must be available for review by
the regulatory authority.
(3) HACCP
A HACCP plan is needed for all curing operations. The following recommendations
must be met to cure meat and poultry products in the establishment. References are
available from local USDA extension offices, public libraries, and college or university
food or meat science departments to develop HACCP plans for curing meat and
poultry.
(a) Critical Control Points
The following are critical control points to be addressed:
(i) Purchase of prepared cure mixes; or
(ii) If cure mixes are blended on the premises instead of acquired
pre-mixed, mixing must be carefully controlled by using calibrated
weighing devices.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
636
 









(iii)	 Cure ingredients must be stored in a dry location. Cure must be
discarded if the package is wet or appears to have been wetted.
(b)	 Raw Material Handling
(i) Thawing must be monitored and controlled to ensure thoroughness
and to prevent temperature abuse. Improperly thawed meat could cause
insufficient cure penetration. Temperature abuse can cause spoilage or
growth of pathogens.
(ii) Meat must be fresh. Curing may not be used to salvage meat that
has excessive bacterial growth or spoilage.
(c)	 Formulating, Preparation and Curing
(i)	 A formulation and preparation procedure must be
documented.

(ii)	 All equipment and utensils must be cleaned and sanitized.
(iii) Pieces must be prepared to uniform sizes to ensure uniform cure
penetration. This is extremely critical for dry and immersion curing.
(iv)	 Calibrated scales must be used to weigh ingredients.
(v) A schedule or recipe must be established for determining the exact
amount of curing formulation to be used for a specified weight of meat or
meat mixture.
(vi) Methods and procedures must be strictly controlled to ensure
uniform cure.
(vii) Mixing of curing formulation with comminuted ingredients must be
controlled and monitored.
(viii) All surfaces of meat must be rotated and rubbed at intervals of
sufficient frequency to ensure cure penetration when a dry curing method
is used.
(ix) Immersion curing requires periodic mixing of the batch to facilitate
uniform curing.
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
637
 








(x) The application of salt during dry curing of muscle cuts requires
that the temperature of the product be strictly controlled between 1.7°C
(35o
F) and 7.2°C (45o
F). The lower temperature is set to limit microbial
growth and the upper temperature is set for the purpose of ensuring cure
penetration. Refer to USDA regulations 9 CFR 318.10(c)(3)(iv) for
specific details on dry curing.
(xi) Curing solutions must be discarded daily unless they remain with
the same batch of product during its entire curing process.
(xii) Injection needles must be inspected for plugging when stitch
pumping or artery pumping of muscle cuts is performed.
(xiii) Sanitary casings must be provided for sausage, chub or loaf
forming.
(xiv) Casings may not be stripped for reuse in forming additional chubs
or sausages from batch to batch.
(xv) Hot curing of bacon bellies, hams, or any other products must be
performed at >49°C (120o
F) as specified in 9 CFR 318.
(d) Cooking and/or Smoking
(i) When smokehouses are initially installed or structurally modified,
calibration of product heating characteristics must be ascertained by
competent food technologists. Tests should be run with full range of
anticipated product loading. Verification of even airflow and moisture
should be recorded in operational records of the smokehouse for these
various loads.
(ii) Procedures for delivering the appropriate thermal treatment of
cooked meats in conformance with the Food Code must be developed
and used. (Also see 9 CFR 318.17 and 318.23 for USDA requirements for
meat products.) A minimum of 73.9°C (165°F) should be used for cured
poultry products.
(iii) Cooking equipment that provides even temperature control of the
heating medium must be used.
(iv) Products must be adequately separated to prevent overlap in the
cooking media whether immersed in hot water, sprayed with hot water,
steamed, or oven heated.
(v) Calibrated temperature measuring devices must be used for
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
638
 








determining internal product temperatures.
(vi) Temperature measuring device probes must be sanitized to
prevent contaminating products when internal temperatures are
measured.
(vii) Calibrated temperature measuring devices must be used for
measuring temperatures of the heating medium.
(viii) Raw products must be separated from cooked products.
(ix) Time/temperature parameters of the cooking process must be
monitored and recorded. In some processes, the heating medium
temperature should also monitored.
(e) Cooling
(i) Cooling must be done in accordance with recommendations in the
Food Code or under a variance. The USDA Cooling Guideline, FSIS
Directive 7110.3 for special procedures for cured products, provides
specific guidance.
(ii) Written cooling procedures must be established.
(iii) Chill water used in water sprays or immersion chilling which is in
direct contact with products in casings or products cooked in an
impervious package must be properly chlorinated.
(iv) Chill water temperature must be monitored and controlled.
(v) Chill water may not be reused until properly chlorinated.
Reclaimed chill water must be discarded daily.
(vi) Product must be placed in a manner that allows chilled water or air
to uniformly contact the product for assurance of uniform cooling.
(vii) Internal temperatures must be monitored during cooling by using
calibrated temperature measuring devices.
(viii) Adequate cooling medium circulation must be maintained and
monitored.
(ix) Temperatures of the cooling medium must be monitored and
recorded in accordance with a written procedure.
(x) Handling of product must be minimized during cooling, peeling of
Annex 6 – Food Processing Criteria
639
 




casing, and packaging. Sanitary gloves must be used in these
procedures.
(f) Fermentation and Drying
(i) Temperature and time must be controlled and logs must be
maintained that record the monitoring of this process.
(ii) Humidity must be controlled by use of a humidistat. Monitoring of
the process must be recorded in a written log.
(iii) Product must be kept separated to allow adequate air circulation
during the process.
(iv) Use of an active and pure culture must be ensured to effect a rapid
pH drop of the product. Use of commercially produced culture is
necessary and the culture must be used according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
(v) Determination of the pH of fermented sausages at the end of the
fermentation cycle must be recorded.
(vi) Handling of products must be minimized and only done with
sanitary gloves or sanitized utensils.
(vii) Dry (unfermented) products may not be hot smoked until the curing
and drying procedures are completed.
(viii) Semi-dry fermented sausage must be heated after fermentation to
a time/temperature sufficient to control growth of pathogenic and spoilage
organisms of concern.
(4) Dedicated Area/Restricted Access
All aspects of curing operations must be conducted in an area specifically designated
for this purpose. There must be an effective separation to prevent cross contamination
between raw and cooked foods or cured and uncured foods. Access to processing
equipment shall be restricted to responsible trained personnel who are familiar with the
potential hazards inherent in curing foods.
(5) Equipment Cleaning and Sanitizing
The procedures for cleaning and sanitization must be accomplished according to parts
4-6 and 4-7 of the Food Code.

Paraphrased from the FDA Food Code for Health Practitioner’s Reference
From Subparagraph 2-201.11(A)(2) Organisms of Concern:
Any foodborne pathogen, with special emphasis on these 56 organisms:
1. Norovirus 2. S. Typhi 3. Shigella spp. 4. E. coli O157:H7 (or other STEC) 5. Hepatitis A virus 6.
Nontyphoidal Salmonella
From Subparagraph 2-201.11(A)(1) Symptoms:
Have any of the following symptoms:
Diarrhea Vomiting Jaundice Sore throat with fever
From Subparagraph 2-201.11(A)(4)-(5) Conditions of Exposure of Concern:
(1) Suspected of causing a foodborne outbreak or being exposed to an outbreak caused by Norovirus, S.
Typhi, Shigella spp., E. coli o157:H7 (or other STEC), Hepatitis A virus , at an event such as a family
meal, church supper, or festival because the person:
Prepared or consumed an implicated food;

or consumed food prepared by a person who is infected or ill with the organism that caused the
outbreak or who is suspected of being a carrier;

(2) Lives with, and has knowledge about, a person who is diagnosed with illness caused by Norovirus, S.
Typhi, Shigella spp., E. coli o157:H7 (or other STEC), Hepatitis A virus ; or
(3) Lives with, and has knowledge about, a person who works where there is an outbreak caused by
Norovirus, S. Typhi, Shigella spp., E. coli o157:H7 (or other STEC), Hepatitis A virus
From Subparagraph 2-201.12 Exclusion and Restriction:
Decisions to exclude or restrict a food employee are made considering the available evidence about the
person=s role in actual or potential foodborne illness transmission. Evidence includes:
Symptoms Diagnosis Past illnesses Stool/blood tests
In facilities serving highly susceptible populations such as day care centers and health care facilities, a person
for whom there is evidence of foodborne illness is almost always excluded from the food establishment.
In other establishments such as restaurants and retail food stored, that offer food to typically healthy consumers,
a person might only be restricted from certain duties, based on the evidence of foodborne illness.
Exclusion from any food establishment is required when the person is:
• Exhibiting or reporting diarrhea or vomiting;
• Diagnosed with illness caused by S. Typhi; or
• Jaundiced within the last 7 days.
For Shigella spp. or Escherichia coli O157:H7 or other STEC infections, the person’s stools must be negative
for 2 consecutive cultures taken no earlier than 48 hours after antibiotics are discontinued, and at least 24 hours
apart or the infected individual must have resolution of symptoms for more than 7 days or at least 7 days have
passed since the employee was diagnosed.

Guide
3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report,
Including Food Code References for Risk Factors/Interventions and
Good Retail Practices
Guide 3-B is intended to be used during inspections to ensure that observations of the
provisions of the Code are not overlooked during the inspection and accurately
recorded on the Food Code Establishment Inspection Report form.
The major headings from the Food Establishment Inspection Report form are
condensed in Guide 3-B into key word phrases to assist the person conducting
inspections in locating the Food Code citation that corresponds to a given violation and
recording inspectional observations. The risk designations (Priority (P), Priority
Foundation (Pf) and Core (C)) have been added to each applicable code section for
reference when recording observations in the inspection report.

B. RISK FACTORS AND INTERVENTIONS
Risk factors are food preparation practices and employee behaviors most commonly reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as contributing factors in foodborne illness outbreaks.
Risk factors include: Food from Unsafe Sources, Improper Holding Temperatures, Inadequate Cooking,
Contaminated Equipment, and Poor Personal Hygiene. These items are prominent on the Food
Establishment Inspection Report because maintaining these items in compliance is vital to preventing
foodborne illness. Additionally, five key public health interventions were introduced in the 1993 Food Code
that supplemented the other interventions long-established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
model codes and guidances to protect consumer health. The five key interventions are: Demonstration of
Knowledge, Employee Health Controls, Controlling Hands as a Vehicle of Contamination, Time and 




GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 3
Temperature Parameters for Controlling Pathogens, and the Consumer Advisory.
For each item on the inspection report form in the Foodborne Illness Risk Factors and Public Health
Interventions section, the inspector should indicate one of the following for COMPLIANCE STATUS: “IN”
which means that the item is in compliance; “OUT” which means that the item is not in compliance;
“N.O.” which means that the item was not observed during the inspection; or “N.A.” which means that the
item is not applicable for the facility. If N.A. or N.O. is not listed as an option for a particular item, this
means that this item must be evaluated during the inspection and a compliance status must be
determined. If the item is marked “OUT”, document details of each violation for the item number in
the “Observations and Corrective Actions” section on the second page of the inspection report.
Compliance status should be determined as a result of observations that establish a pattern of non
compliance. Consideration should be given to the seriousness of the observation with regard to
prevention of foodborne illness.
­
For items marked “OUT,” further indicate the status of the violation by marking an “X” in the
corresponding box for Corrected On-Site (COS) during the inspection and/or Repeat violation (R). Marking
COS indicates that all violations cited under that particular item number have been corrected and verified
before completing the inspection. The actual corrective action taken for each violation should be
documented in the “Observations and Corrective Actions” section of the inspection report. For example,
Item #10 Handwashing sink is marked out of compliance because the establishment does not have soap
and paper towels at the handwashing sink. The person in charge partially corrects the problem by putting
soap at the sink, but does not replace the paper towels or provide any other effective means for drying
hands. The corrective action taken for the soap is documented in the narrative on the form, but COS is
not marked for Item #10 because all violations under that item were not corrected. Marking R indicates
that the same violation under a particular item number was cited on the last inspection report. Using the
same scenario, on the subsequent inspection if the provision of soap and paper towels is not in violation,
but employees are not washing hands in the correct sink (which is also cited under Item #8 Handwashing
sink), R would not be marked because this is a new violation which was not cited on the previous
inspection report.
C. MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH RISK FACTOR AND INTERVENTION ON THE
INSPECTION REPORT
Supervision
1. PIC present, demonstrates knowledge, and performs duties
IN/OUT	 This item must be marked IN or OUT of compliance. The person in charge (PIC) has three
assigned responsibilities – Presence; Demonstration of Knowledge; and Duties. This item is
marked OUT of compliance if any one of the responsibilities is not met.
A.	 Person in charge is present. This item is marked OUT of compliance if there is no PIC
per 2-101.11(A) and (B).
B.	 Demonstration of Knowledge. The PIC has three options for demonstrating knowledge.
This item is marked IN compliance if the PIC meets at least one of the options. The three
options for demonstration of knowledge allowed by the Food Code are:
1.	 Certification by an ACCREDITED PROGRAM as specified in 2-102-20.
2.	 Complying with this Code by having no violations of priority items during the current
inspection; or 








GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 4
3.	 Correct responses to the inspector's questions regarding public health practices and
principles applicable to the operation. The inspector should assess this item by asking
open-ended questions that would evaluate the PIC's knowledge in each of the areas
enumerated in ¶ 2-102.11(C)(1), (4)-(16). Questions can be asked during the initial
interview, menu review, or throughout the inspection as appropriate. The Inspector
should ask a sufficient number of questions to enable the inspector to make an
informed decision concerning the PIC's knowledge of the Code requirements and
public health principles as they apply to the operation. The dialogue should be
extensive enough to reveal whether or not that person is enabled by a clear
understanding of the Code and its public health principles to follow sound food safety
practices and to produce foods that are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and
accurately represented.
C.	 Duties of the PIC. This item must be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on the
interaction and observation with the PIC and food employee. The inspector needs to
determine the systems or controls the PIC has put into practice regarding oversight
and/or routine monitoring of the Duties listed in § 2-103.11. This is accomplished by 1)
discussion with the PIC, and 2) verified through observation that the systems or controls
are actually being implemented. This concept is commonly referred to as Active
Managerial Control. This item must be marked OUT of compliance when there is a
pattern of non-compliance and obvious failure by the PIC to ensure employees are
complying with the duties listed in § 2-103.11. Since marking this item out of compliance
requires judgment, it is important that this item not be marked for an isolated incident, but
rather for an overall evaluation of the PIC's ability to ensure compliance with the duties
described in § 2-103.11.

18. Proper cooking time and temperatures
NOTE:	 The cooking temperatures of foods must be measured to determine compliance or
noncompliance. Do not rely upon discussions with managers or cooks to make a determination
of compliance or noncompliance. The temperature of raw animal foods in each species cooked
during the inspection should be taken. For instance, if the facility fries chicken, scrambles
eggs, bakes fish, grills hamburgers, and slow-roasts prime rib during the inspection – the cook
temperatures of all of the products should be measured and recorded. Temperatures, both IN
compliance and OUT of compliance, should be recorded in the “Temperature Observations”
section of the inspection report. If there is insufficient space for the number of temperatures
taken, additional temperatures should be documented in the “Observations and Corrective
Actions” section on the second page of the inspection report. The time of inspections should be
varied so that cooking can be observed.
IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance. This item should be marked OUT of
compliance if the items checked do not meet the temperature requirements for cooking and
the employee doing the cooking attempts to serve the product without returning the product to
the cooking process. If a food is cooked below the required temperature but the facility has an
approved Consumer Advisory or an approved variance with HACCP plan for that food item,
mark the item IN compliance, record the temperature and document the reason it is IN
compliance. Foods cooked with a non-continuous cooking process are marked OUT of
compliance if the food item does not meet the time/temperature requirements for cooking as
specified in 3-401.11(A)-(C) and if written procedures describing how the foods are prepared
and stored after initial heating but prior to cooking for sale or service are not available for
review.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when no raw animal foods are cooked in the establishment.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. when you are unable to determine the cooking temperature of
any food. The inspection should be arranged at an optimum time for measuring at least one
cooked item.

19. Proper reheating procedures for hot holding
NOTE:	 The reheating temperatures of foods must be taken to determine compliance or
noncompliance. Do not rely solely upon discussions with managers or cooks to determine
compliance or noncompliance. Temperatures IN and OUT of compliance should be recorded
in the “Temperature Observations” section of the inspection report. If there is insufficient space
for the number of temperatures taken, additional temperatures should be documented in the
“Observations and Corrective Actions” section of the inspection report.
IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on actual temperature
measurements of foods upon completion of the reheating process and prior to being placed in
hot holding using a calibrated food temperature measuring device. This item should be marked
OUT of compliance if the items checked are not reheated to the required temperatures or
within 2 hours prior to hot holding.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when foods are not held over for a second service and/or
reheating for hot holding is not performed in the establishment.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. such as when foods are held over for a second service, but no
foods are reheated during the time of inspection.

3-403.11 Reheating for Hot Holding (P) 











GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 14
20. Proper cooling time and temperatures
NOTE:	 The requirement for cooling cooked TCS food, is that the food must be cooled from 135°F to
41°F or less in 6 hrs provided that the food is cooled from 135°F to 70°F within the first 2
hours. For example, if a facility cools chili from 135°F to 70°F in 1.5 hours; they then have 4.5
hours to get it from 70°F to 41°F or less. There are two critical limits that must be met with
cooling. Discussions with the person in charge along with observations should be used to
determine compliance. For instance, during discussion the person in charge says that a food
product was cooled overnight in the walk-in cooler. The product is checked and the
temperature is 50°F. Eight hours have elapsed from closing to opening. This item should be
marked OUT because the product did not cool from 135°F to 70°F within two hours and from
135°F to 41°F or less within a total of 6 hours. Temperatures IN compliance and OUT of
compliance should be recorded in the “Temperature Observations” section of the inspection
report. If there is insufficient space for the number of temperatures taken, additional
temperatures should be documented in the “Observations and Corrective Actions” section of
the inspection report. Because the entire cooling process is difficult to observe during an
inspection, at the onset of the inspection a determination of whether foods are currently being
cooled should be made. If cooling is taking place, temperatures should be taken to make a
determination of whether proper cooling is possible with procedures being used.
IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on actual temperatures of TCS
foods in the cooling process. The basis for determining IN or OUT of compliance can also be
supported through discussion and/or record review which would provide the inspector reliable
data of the “start time” for cooling from 135°F. See above NOTE for an example of using
actual temperature and discussion with the PIC in determining OUT of compliance without
actually being at the establishment during the entire cooling of TCS process, from start to
finish.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when the establishment does not receive raw eggs, shellstock,
or milk, prepares no TCS food from ambient temperature ingredients that require cooling, and
does not cool cooked TCS food.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. when the establishment does cool TCS food, but proper cooling
per the prescribed temperature and time parameters cannot be determined during the length of
the inspection.
Applicable Code Sections:
3-501.14 Cooling (P)

22. Proper cold holding temperatures
NOTE:	 Temperatures IN compliance and OUT of compliance should be recorded in the “Temperature
Observations” section of the inspection report. If there is insufficient space for the number of
temperatures taken, additional temperatures should be documented in the “Observations and
Corrective Action” section of the inspection report.
IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on actual food temperature
measurements using a calibrated food temperature measuring device. Discussions should be
made with the PIC to determine if a food is in the process of cooling, TPHC is used, or there is
an approved method to render a food so that it is not TCS food. This item should be marked
IN compliance when the regulatory authority determines that, of the temperature
measurements taken during the inspection, no cold holding temperatures are greater than
prescribed by the Code. This item should be marked OUT of compliance if one TCS food is
found out of temperature, with supportive evidence, unless TPHC is used for that TCS food.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when the establishment does not cold hold food.
N.O	 This item may be marked N.O. when the establishment does cold hold food, but no foods are
being held cold during the time of inspection. Inspections should be conducted during a time
when hot holding temperatures can be taken.
Applicable Code Sections:
3-501.16(A)(2) and (B) Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food, Hot and Cold Holding (P)
23. Proper date marking and disposition
IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance. This item would be IN compliance
when there is a system in place for date marking all foods that are required to be date marked
and is verified through observation. If date marking applies to the establishment, the PIC
should be asked to describe the methods used to identify product shelf-life or “consume-by”
dating. The regulatory authority must be aware of food products that are listed as exempt from
date marking. For disposition, mark IN when foods are all within date marked time limits or
food is observed being discarded within date marked time limits or OUT of compliance, such
as when date marked food exceeds the time limit or date-marking is not done.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when there is no ready-to-eat, TCS food prepared on-premise
and held, or commercial containers of ready-to-eat, TCS food opened and held, over 24 hours
in the establishment.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. when the establishment does handle foods requiring date
marking, but there are no foods requiring date marking in the facility at the time of inspection.
Applicable Code Sections:
3-501.17 Ready-To-Eat Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food, Date Marking (Pf)
3-501.18 Ready-To-Eat Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food, Disposition (P)

IN/OUT	 This item should be marked IN or OUT of compliance based on direct observations, record
review, a discussion with the PIC, and the review of any standard operating procedures to
determine if the intent of the Code for use of TPHC is met. This provision only applies if it is
the actual intention or conscious decision by the PIC to store TCS food out of temperature
control using TPHC; otherwise, it may be a cold or hot holding issue. This item should be
marked IN compliance if there is a written procedure at the food establishment that identifies
the types of food products that will be held using time only, describes the procedure for how
TPHC will be implemented, and if applicable delineates how food items, previously cooked and 













GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 16
cooled before time is used, are properly cooled; and food items (marked or identified) do not
exceed the 4-hour limit at any temperature or 6-hour limit at 70°F or less. This item should be
marked OUT of compliance when the PIC implies the use of TPHC but does not have an
effective mechanism for indicating the point in time when the food is removed from
temperature control to the 4 or 6-hour discard time, or a written procedure or an effective
mechanism for using TPHC is not present at the facility.
N.A	 This item may be marked N.A. when the establishment does not use time only as the public
health control.

of the posted, written and special/daily menus, to determine if untreated shell eggs, meats,
fish, or poultry are used as an ingredient or ordered as a raw, raw-marinated, partially cooked,
or undercooked food. The advisory also applies to shellstock offered for sale from a retail
service case. This item should be marked IN compliance if the establishment provides an
advisory that meets the intent of the Food Code for both the disclosure and reminder
components. This item should be marked OUT of compliance when raw or undercooked foods
are served or sold and there is no consumer advisory, the food item is not disclosed, or there
is no reminder statement. The consumer advisory does not exempt the requirement for
freezing for parasite control, nor should it be used for foods that have only gone through the
initial heating and cooling stages of a non-continuous cooking process.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. when a food establishment does not serve a ready-to-eat food

Good Retail Practices (GRPs)
D. MARKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH GOOD RETAIL PRACTICE (GRP) ON THE INSPECTION
REPORT
Good Retail Practices (GRPs) are systems to control basic operational and sanitation conditions within a
facility, and if not controlled, they could be contributing factors to foodborne illness by introducing hazards
(biological, chemical and physical), into the end product, either directly or indirectly. For example,
equipment in disrepair, such as a cutting board with deep grooves/cuts, makes effective cleaning difficult
or impossible, and thereby could introduce a bacterial hazard onto food that comes into contact with the
board. In addition, in assessing GRPs, it is important to make an overall assessment of the conditions by
looking for trends versus an isolated incident; and the potential public health impact. For example, a few
missing floor tiles in a dry area may not rise to the level of a “violation”; however, missing floor tiles in an
area where equipment is subject to in-place manual cleaning without the use of an enclosed clean in place
(CIP) system, i.e., using pressure hoses over band saws, slicers, or mixers, could create conditions
whereby a bacterial hazard could be introduced on to the food equipment. These items usually require
judgment, and if uncorrected, the regulatory authority must decide whether or not these conditions would
lead to potential contamination.
GRPs are the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the receiving, preparation, storage,
serving, packaging or holding of food which are designed to assure unsanitary conditions do not lead to
the introduction of hazards or unintentional substances into the end product. The intention of this
inspection form is to focus the inspector’s attention on those factors that have been shown to be most
often linked with causing foodborne illness. Since the major emphasis of an inspection should be on the
Risk Factors that cause foodborne illness and the Public Health interventions that have the greatest
impact on preventing foodborne illness, the GRPs have been given less importance on the inspection
form and a differentiation between IN, OUT, N.A. and N.O. is not made in this area, with a few exceptions
noted below. For marking the GRPs section, place an “X” in the box to the left of the numbered item if a
code provision under that item is OUT of compliance. Document each violation of the code provision for
the item number in the “Observations and Corrective Actions” section on the second page of the
inspection report. For items marked OUT of compliance, further indicate the VIOLATION STATUS by
marking an “X” in the corresponding box: COS = Corrected on site during inspection and R = Repeat
violation per the same instructions as given in the Risk Factor section. References to the appropriate Food
Code provisions that can be debited under each numbered GRP item are listed in Guide 3-B.
Note: Items 30, 32, and 33 will allow for either three or four marking options. Item 30 allows for IN OUT
or N.A., and items 32 and 33 allow for IN, OUT, N.A .or N.O. For marking in the GRP Section place an
“A” in the box to the left of the numbered item if the code provision under that item is not applicable or
and “O” for not observed.
E. TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS
Item/location Record the common name of the food as well as the condition, process, and location of
the food at the time of monitoring e.g. hot holding, refrigerator, prep-table. Temperatures
in compliance and out of compliance should be documented. If there is insufficient space
for the number of temperatures taken, record the additional temperatures in the
“Observations and Corrective Actions” section of the inspection report. 





GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 20
Food
Temperature	 Record the temperature indicated on the inspector’s thermometer. Specify the
measurement in °F or °C. (Note: Food temperature measuring devices that are scaled
only in Fahrenheit should be accurate to ±2°F in the intended range of use. Food
temperature measuring devices that are scaled only in Celsius or dually scaled in Celsius
and Fahrenheit should be accurate to ± 1°C in the intended range of use.)
F. OBSERVATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Include here specific descriptions of violations observed and recorded in the Risk Factors and
Interventions section and Good Retail Practices check boxes. Also include corrective actions for the
noted violations and temperatures if there is insufficient space in the allotted section for temperature
recordings.

Safe Food and Water
30. Pasteurized eggs used where required
Certain menu items use eggs as an ingredient in the preparation of RTE foods, such as Caesar salad,
Hollandaise sauce, etc. This is verified by discussion with the PIC and food employees regarding the
substitution of pasteurized egg products for raw eggs in uncooked foods, unless allowed under
¶ 3-401.11(D)(2).
Applicable Code Section:
3-302.13	 Pasteurized Eggs Substituted for Raw Eggs for Certain Recipes (P)
31. Water and ice from approved source
There are two types of systems: Public W ater System or Non-Public W ater System. Regardless of its
source, it must meet drinking water standards established by EPA and applicable state drinking water
quality standards. If a non-public system is used as Drinking water, the water is sampled / tested at least
yearly and records retained on file at the food establishment or per state regulations. Consideration must
be given to the supply containers, piping, hoses, etc., connected to the APPROVED source when water is
made available for mobile and/or temporary food establishment without a permanent supply.

32. Variance obtained for specialized processing methods
W hen a Food Establishment wants to deviate from a requirement in the code, utilizes Specialized
Processing Methods as specified in § 3-502.11 such as Smoking Food for Preservation, curing food etc. a
variance must first be obtained from the regulatory authority. A HACCP plan may also be required as
listed in ¶ 8-201.13(A) as part of the variance request.
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. if the establishment is not engaged in a specialized processing
method, other operation requiring a variance and a HACCP plan or a process or processing
method determined by the regulatory authority to require a variance and a HACCP plan.
Applicable Code Section:
8-103.11 Documentation of Proposed Variance and Justification (Pf)
Food Temperature Control
33. Proper cooling methods used; adequate equipment for temperature control
A determination must first be made that cooling food is part of the processing step. To assess whether or
not the methods used facilitate the cooling criteria specified under § 3-501.14, a discussion with the PIC
should support actual observations used in cooling foods. There should be enough equipment with
sufficient capacity used for the cooling, heating and hot/cold holding of foods requiring temperature control
as specified in Chapter 3 to meet the demands of the operation. Observations must support the
determination of compliance status. Frozen food is solid to the touch.

N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. if vegetables and fruits are not cooked for hot holding in the
establishment.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. when plant foods are cooked for hot holding, but are not
available for observation during the inspection.
Applicable Code Section:
3-401.13 Plant Food Cooking for Hot Holding (Pf)
35. Approved thawing methods used
Observing and then gaining an understanding of the establishment’s thawing method(s) will help in
determining whether a violation exists from the approved thawing methods found under § 3-501.13 as well
as the level of risk imposed. Keep in mind that various food products especially those destined for deepfat frying are often slacked (not thawed) prior to cooking.
Applicable Code Sections:
3-501.12 Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food, Slacking (C)
3-501.13 Thawing (C)
N.A.	 This item may be marked N.A. if TCS food are not thawed.
N.O.	 This item may be marked N.O. if this food is thawed, but thawing was not observed during the
inspection. 






















GUIDE 3-B Instructions for Marking the Food Establishment Inspection Report – page 22
36. Thermometers provided and accurate
Thermometers provide a means for assessing active managerial control of TCS food temperatures.
Determine compliance by observing the in-use storage location and verifying the scaling of
the temperature measuring devices in the range of use to measure food, water, or ambient air
temperatures. Food thermometers must be calibrated at a frequency to ensure accuracy. Food
thermometers should be accessible for use by employees and have a probe size appropriate to
the food item.

Food Identification
37. Food properly labeled; original container
Packaged foods are required to conform to specific labeling laws. Foods packaged within the food
establishment must also conform to the appropriate labeling laws, with considerations given to accuracy
as well as not being misleading. In addition, all major food allergens, if present, must be accurately
declared on the package. W orking containers and bulk foods removed from their original packaging
require some level of assessment as to how recognizable the food is without labeling by its common
name. Molluscan shellfish and vended TCS foods must specifically be assessed based on their specific
packaging and labeling requirements.

Chart 4-D
FDA Food Code Mobile Food Establishment Matrix
This table is a plan review and inspectional guide for mobile food establishments based
on the mobile unit's menu and operation. Mobile units range in type from push carts to
food preparation catering vehicles.
To use the table, read down the columns based on the menu and operation in use. For
example, if only prepackaged time/temperature control for safety food is served, then
requirements listed in the TCS Food Menu - Prepackaged column apply. Likewise, if
only food that is not time/temperature control for safety food is prepared on board, then
requirements listed in the Not TCS Menu - Food Preparation column apply. Note that
if a mobile food establishment has available for sale to the consumer both prepackaged
time/temperature control for safety food and time/temperature control for safety food
prepared on board, then the more stringent requirements of the TCS Menu - Food
Preparation column apply.
It is important to remember that mobile units may also be subject to all Food Code
provisions that apply to food establishments. Consult the local regulatory authority for
specific local requirements.
The local regulatory authority's decision to require auxiliary support services such as a
commissary or servicing area should be based on the menu, type of operation, and
availability of on-board or on-site equipment.
NOTE: The Food Code definition of "Food Establishment" does not include an
establishment that offers only prepackaged foods that are not time/temperature control
for safety foods.

Summary of Changes

In the FDA Food Code

This Summary provides a synopsis of the textual changes from the 2009 FDA Food
Code and the Supplement to the 2009 Food Code Chapters and Annexes to the 2013
edition. The primary intent of this record is to capture the nature of the changes rather
than to identify every word or editing change. This record should not be relied upon
as an absolute comparison that identifies each and every change.
General:
•	 Numerous editing changes were made throughout the document for internal
consistency, to correct some errors in the 2009 Code and for clarification.
•	 Section and paragraph numbers listed refer to the 2009 Code and its
Supplement unless otherwise noted. The numbering system was removed from
Chapter 1 definitions in the 2005 version of this Code. An explanation regarding
the rationale can be found in Annex 3, 1-201.10(B).
•	 Updated the web links throughout the Code and Annexes.
•	 Converted several Tables, charts, and images throughout the Code to meet web
accessibility requirements under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

Preface
Amended Preface sections 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 to add updated information and revise dates
to make current.
Chapter 1 Purpose and Definitions
Deleted “Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli” (EHEC) as use of EHEC terminology
is outdated.
Summary 1 







Amended “Packaged” in (1) to delete the term “securely” to avoid undue emphasis on
nature of the package; Amended "Packaged" in (2) to remove the phrase “or other
nondurable container” to clarify when foods packaged at retail need to be labeled so
that it reads: "Packaged" does not include wrapped or placed in a carry-out container
to protect the FOOD during service or delivery to the CONSUMER, by a FOOD EMPLOYEE,
upon CONSUMER request.
Deleted the term Potentially Hazardous Food (Time/Temperature Control for Safety
Food)” (PHF/TCS) and made a universal change throughout the Code to replace it with
the term “Time/Temperature Control for Safety Food” (TCS). The definition remains
the same.
Revised “Reduced Oxygen Packaging” subparagraph (2)(e), to delete the phrase
“placed in a hermetically sealed, impermeable bag” and replace it with “vacuum
packaged in an impermeable bag” so it clearly defines the sous vide process as outlined
in Annex 6(2)(B)(4)(b). It now reads: “Sous vide PACKAGING, in which raw or partially
cooked FOOD is vacuum packaged in an impermeable bag, cooked in the bag, rapidly
chilled, and refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic
pathogens.”
Revised "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli" (STEC) to reflect current
nomenclature.
Chapter 2 Management and Personnel
2-201.11, 2-201.12, 2-201.13
Amended to add nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) as one of the reportable illnesses for
action by the Person in Charge; Added Code language to address employee health
controls for the exclusion and restriction of nontyphoidal Salmonella, and removal of
exclusion and restriction from NTS.
2-301.14(H)
Amended to clarify that the requirement to wash hands before donning gloves is specific
to the beginning of a task involving working with food and not during the task.
2-301.16(A)(2)
Amended to remove (A)(2)(b)(i-ii) and add new subparagraphs (A)(2)(b-e) to clarify and
align the codified text with applicable CFR’s and the FD&C Act with regard to the use of
hand antiseptics as a food additive.
Summary 2 







Chapter 3 Food
3-201.16(A)

3-403.11
Amended ¶3-403.11(C) to clarify that this provision applies to all commercially

Amended to add new ¶(F) that exempts raw, live in-shell molluscan shellfish from date
marking and re-designated former ¶(F) as new ¶(G).
Amended existing subparagraph 3-501.17 (F)(6) to clarify that the exemption from date
marking for shelf stable dry fermented sausages produced in USDA-regulated facilities
is not dependent on the product retaining the original casing; Renumbered existing
¶(F)(6) as new ¶(G)(6) as a result of the addition of new ¶ (F).
3-502.11
Amended to revise ¶(D) to make clear that only TCS foods prepared under ROP
methods that do not control for growth of and toxin formation by Clostridium botulinum
and the growth of Listeria monocytogenes require a variance.
3-502.12
Amended ¶¶3-502.12(B), (D), and (E) lead-in paragraphs to reference new ¶ (F) of this
section.
Amended ¶3-502.12(B) lead in paragraph and subparagraphs (B)(6)(c), (D)(1), and
(E)(2) to reference ¶8-201.14(B) along with existing reference to ¶ (D).
Amended subparagraphs 3-502.12(B)(3)(b) and (B)(4) to delete 14 days and add 30
days.

Amended ¶3-602.11(B)(2),(3),(5), and (7) to clarify the information that a label should
include.
Amended subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(2) to clarify what information must be included in
the statement of ingredients. The term “sub ingredients” was added to this
subparagraph to clarify that individual component ingredients of a main ingredient must
be disclosed in the statement of ingredients. This clarification helps to make clear that
all individual ingredients in a packaged food will be disclosed in the statement of
ingredients.
Amended subparagraph 3-602.11(C)(2) to remove cross reference to subparagraph
(B)(5) to correctly refer to what a labeling device such as a card, sign, or other method
of notification needs to declare. This change corrects an inadvertent error that was
created in the 2005 Food Code when a new subparagraph (B)(5) for food allergens was
added and the subparagraph for nutritional labeling was renumbered to (B)(6), but the
accompanying cross reference in (C)(2) was not changed to correctly cross reference
(B)(1), (2), and (6), nutritional labeling.
