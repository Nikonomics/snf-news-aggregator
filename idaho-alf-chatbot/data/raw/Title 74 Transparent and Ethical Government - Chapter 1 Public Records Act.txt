74-102. PUBLIC RECORDS -- RIGHT TO EXAMINE. (1) Every person has a right
to examine and take a copy of any public record of this state and there is a
presumption that all public records in Idaho are open at all reasonable times
for inspection except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.
(2) The right to copy public records shall include the right to make
photographs or photographic or other copies while the records are in the possession of the custodian of the records using equipment provided by the public agency or using equipment designated by the custodian.
(3) Additionally, the custodian of any public record shall give the
person, on demand, a certified copy of it if the record is of a nature
permitting such copying or shall furnish reasonable opportunity to inspect
or copy such record.
(4) A public agency may require that a request for public records be
submitted to it in a writing that specifically describes the subject matter and records sought, including a specific date range for when the records
sought were created. The requesting party shall be as specific as possible
when requesting records. A request shall describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable the public body to locate such records with reasonable
3
effort. A request shall also provide the requester's name, mailing address,
email address, telephone number, and a written declaration by the requesting party attesting or affirming under oath whether such requester is a resident. A request for public records and delivery of the public records may be
made by electronic mail.
(5) The custodian shall make no inquiry of any person who requests a
public record, except:
(a) To verify the identity of the requester in accordance with section
74-113, Idaho Code; or
(b) To ensure that the requested record or information will not be
used for purposes of a mailing or telephone list prohibited by section
74-120, Idaho Code, or as otherwise provided by law; or
(c) As required for purposes of protecting personal information from
disclosure under chapter 2, title 49, Idaho Code, and federal law.
(6) The custodian shall not review, examine or scrutinize any copy,
photograph or memoranda in the possession of any such person and shall extend
to the person all reasonable comfort and facility for the full exercise of
the right granted under this act.
(7) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the custodian from maintaining such vigilance as is required to prevent alteration of any public
record while it is being examined.
(8) Examination of public records under the authority of this section
must be conducted during regular office or working hours unless the custodian shall authorize examination of records in other than regular office or
working hours. In this event, the persons designated to represent the custodian during such examination shall be entitled to reasonable compensation
to be paid to them by the public agency having custody of such records, out of
funds provided in advance by the person examining such records, at other than
regular office or working hours.
(9) The public agency may provide the requester information to help the
requester narrow the scope of the request or to help the requester make the
request more specific when the response to the request is likely to be voluminous or require payment as provided in subsection (10) of this section.
(10)(a) Except for fees that are authorized or prescribed under other
provisions of Idaho law, no fee shall be charged for the first two (2)
hours of labor in responding to a request submitted by a resident for
public records, or for copying the first one hundred (100) pages of paper records that are requested by a resident.
(b) A public agency or public official may establish fees to recover
the actual labor and copying costs associated with locating and copying
documents if:
(i) The request is for more than one hundred (100) pages of paper
records; or
(ii) The request includes records from which nonpublic information must be deleted; or
(iii) The actual labor associated with responding to requests for
public records in compliance with the provisions of this chapter
exceeds two (2) person hours.
(c) A public agency or public official may establish separate copying
fee schedules for requests submitted by residents and requests submitted by persons who are not residents. The fee for residents may not exceed the actual cost to the agency of copying the record if another fee
is not otherwise provided by law.
4
(d)(i) For providing a duplicate of a computer tape, computer
disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing
public record information, a public agency or public official may
charge a fee, uniform to all residents, that does not exceed the
sum of the following:
1. The agency's direct cost of copying the information in
that form;
2. The standard cost, if any, for selling the same information in the form of a publication;
3. The agency's cost of conversion, or the cost of conversion charged by a third party, if the existing electronic
record is converted to another electronic form.
(ii) A public agency or public official may charge additional
fees, uniform to all persons who are not residents, for requests
involving duplication of a computer tape, computer disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing public
record information.
(e) Fees for requests made by residents shall not exceed reasonable
labor costs necessarily incurred in responding to a public records
request, and if charged, shall reflect the personnel and quantity of
time that are reasonably necessary to process a request. Fees for
requests made by residents for labor costs shall be charged at the per
hour pay rate of the lowest paid administrative staff employee or public
official of the public agency who is necessary and qualified to process
the request. If a request from a resident requires redactions to be made
by an attorney who is employed by the public agency, the rate charged
shall be no more than the per hour rate of the lowest paid attorney
within the public agency who is necessary and qualified to process the
public records request. If a request from a resident is submitted to
a public agency that does not have an attorney on staff, and requires
redactions by an attorney, the rate shall be no more than the usual and
customary rate of the attorney who is retained by the public agency for
that purpose.
(f) The public agency shall not charge any cost or fee for copies
or labor when the requester is a resident and demonstrates that the
requester's examination and/or copying of public records:
(i) Is likely to contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations or activities of the government;
(ii) Is not primarily in the individual interest of the requester
including, but not limited to, the requester's interest in litigation in which the requester is or may become a party; and
(iii) Will not occur if fees are charged because the requester has
insufficient financial resources to pay such fees.
(g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a public
agency or public official may charge fees for labor and copying costs
associated with locating and copying documents requested by a person
who is not a resident or an employee of a resident. The fee rates and
schedule for requests made by persons who are not residents or employees
of residents shall be at the discretion of the public agency or public
official as long as such fees do not exceed actual costs of the public
agency or public official.
(h) Statements of fees by a public agency shall be itemized to show the
per page costs for copies, and hourly rates of employees and attorneys
5
involved in responding to the request, and the actual time spent on the
public records request. No lump sum costs shall be assigned to any public records request. If a separate fee schedule is adopted for requests
from persons who are not residents or employees of residents, the separate fees for such nonresidents shall be separately identified.
(11) A requester may not file multiple requests for public records
solely to avoid payment of fees. When a public agency reasonably believes
that one (1) or more requesters is segregating a request into a series of
requests to avoid payment of fees authorized pursuant to this section, the
public agency may aggregate such requests and charge the appropriate fees.
The public agency may consider the time period in which the requests have
been made in its determination to aggregate the related requests. A public
agency shall not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one
(1) requester.
(12) The custodian may require advance payment of fees authorized by
this section. Any money received by the public agency shall be credited to
the account for which the expense being reimbursed was or will be charged,
and such funds may be expended by the agency as part of its appropriation from
that fund. Any portion of an advance payment in excess of the actual costs of
labor and copying incurred by the agency in responding to the request shall
be returned to the requester.
(13) A public agency shall not prevent the examination or copying of a
public record by contracting with a nongovernmental body to perform any of
its duties or functions.
(14) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from disclosing statistical information that is descriptive of an identifiable person or persons, unless prohibited by law.
(15) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from providing a copy of a public record in electronic form if the record is available
in electronic form and if the person specifically requests an electronic
copy.
(16) A public agency or elected official shall designate a custodian or
custodians for all public records, which includes any public official having
custody of, control of, or authorized access to public records and also includes all delegates of such officials, employees or representatives.

74-103. REQUEST AND RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR EXAMINATION OF PUBLIC
RECORDS. (1) All requests to examine public records shall be made to the
designated custodian of such records as defined in section 74-101(3),
Idaho Code. A public agency, a public official, or an employee of a public
agency shall have no obligation and shall not be deemed to have assumed any
obligation to respond to a public records request that fails to comply with
the requirements of this subsection. A public records request must clearly
indicate that it is a public records request.
(2) A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a resident's
request to examine or copy public records within three (3) working days of
the date of the receipt of the request for examination or copying. A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a request from a person
who is not a resident and not employed by a resident to examine or copy public records within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the receipt of the re-
6
quest for examination or copying. If it is determined by employees of the
public agency that a longer period of time is needed to locate or retrieve
the public records, the public agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy the records and shall provide the public
records no later than ten (10) working days following the person's request,
if such person is a resident, and no later than thirty-five (35) days following a request from a nonresident. Additionally, if it is determined that
the existing electronic record requested will first have to be converted to
another electronic format by the agency or by a third party and that such conversion cannot be completed within the time allotted for the response, the
agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy
the records. The agency shall provide the converted public record at a time
mutually agreed upon between the agency and the requester, with due consideration given to any limitations that may exist due to the process of conversion or due to the use of a third party to make the conversion.
(3) If the public agency or custodian fails to respond within the time
allotted for the response, the request shall be deemed to be denied.
(4) If the public agency denies the person's request for examination
or copying the public records or denies in part and grants in part the person's request for examination and copying of the public records, the person
legally responsible for administering the public agency or that person's designee shall notify the person in writing of the denial or partial denial of
the request for the public record.
(5) The notice of denial or partial denial shall state that the attorney
for the public agency has reviewed the request or shall state that the public agency has had an opportunity to consult with an attorney regarding the
request for examination or copying of a record and has chosen not to do so.
The notice of denial or partial denial also shall indicate the statutory authority for the denial and indicate clearly the person's right to appeal the
denial or partial denial and the time periods for doing so.

as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public agency shall, upon
receipt of a request for disclosure, separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination, provided
that a denial of a request to copy nonexempt material in a public record shall
not be based upon the fact that such nonexempt material is contained in the
same public record as the exempt material.

act, the federal clean water act and the resource conservation and
recovery act, and the implementing state statutes, federal regulations
and state rules, unless the record is a trade secret.
(2) For purposes of this section, a record, or a portion of the record,
is a "trade secret" if the information contained in the record is a trade secret within the meaning of the Idaho trade secrets act, sections 48-801, et
seq., Idaho Code, including commercial or financial information which, if
disclosed, could cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom
the record was obtained.
(3) Any record, or portion of a record, provided to or obtained by the
department of environmental quality and identified by the person providing
the record as a trade secret shall not be disclosed to the public and shall be
kept confidential according to the procedures established in this section.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the disclosure of a trade secret by the department of environmental quality:
(a) To any officer, employee, or authorized representative of the state
or the United States, under a continuing claim of confidentiality, as
necessary to carry out the provisions of state or federal law, or when
relevant to any proceeding thereunder;
(b) As determined necessary by the director of the department of environmental quality (under a continuing confidentiality claim) to protect the public health and safety from imminent and substantial endangerment;

(5) It shall be the responsibility of any person providing a record to
the department of environmental quality to give notice of the existence of
a trade secret on each page or other portion of information at the time of
25
submittal, and such person shall have the burden of demonstrating that the
information is a trade secret.
(6) Notwithstanding the time frames set forth in section 74-103(2),
Idaho Code, when a request is made to the department of environmental quality
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for the disclosure of information
for which a trade secret claim has been made, and the information has not
been demonstrated to be a trade secret to the satisfaction of the director
of the department of environmental quality, within three (3) working days of
receipt of the request for the disclosure of the information, the department
of environmental quality shall provide a written request for substantiation
to the person making the confidentiality claim. A response shall be submitted to the department of environmental quality by the person claiming the
trade secret protection within ten (10) working days after receipt of the
request for substantiation, or the information subject to the claim shall be
disclosed without further notice. Upon receipt of a timely response to the
request for substantiation, the director of the department of environmental
quality shall determine whether the information is a trade secret subject to
protection.
(a) If it is determined that the information, or any portion of the information, is a trade secret, within three (3) working days after receipt of the response, the director of the department of environmental
quality shall notify the person requesting the information that the request is denied pursuant to subsections (4) and (5) of section 74-103,
Idaho Code.
(b) If it is determined that the information, or any portion of the
information, is not a trade secret and is, therefore, subject to disclosure, within three (3) working days after receipt of the response,

the person making the confidentiality claim of the determination. The
decision shall be a final agency action directly appealable, de novo, to
the district court of the county where the records or some part thereof
are located. An appeal contesting the decision of the director of the
department of environmental quality to release information claimed to
be a trade secret shall be filed within ten (10) working days from the
date of receipt of the written notice of decision. The information
claimed to be a trade secret shall not be disclosed until the period
for appeal has expired with no appeal being taken, or a court order has
been issued finding that the information is not a trade secret and all
appeals of that order have been exhausted.
(7) In any appeal taken pursuant to this section, the court may award
reasonable costs and attorney's fees to the prevailing party if it finds the
claim of confidentiality or the decision of the director of the department of
environmental quality to provide records was frivolously pursued.
(8) The department of environmental quality shall adopt rules which include:
(a) Appropriate measures to safeguard and protect against improper
disclosure of trade secrets, including procedures to train all employees on the proper handling of trade secrets; and
(b) Any other provisions necessary to carry out this section.
(9) As it relates to the department of environmental quality, or to
agents, contractors, or other representatives of the department, the immunity created in section 74-118, Idaho Code, shall apply only when disclosure
of a trade secret is made consistent with this section.

chapter. The petition contesting the public agency's decision shall be
filed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of mailing
of the notice of denial or partial denial by the public agency. In cases
in which the records requested are claimed as exempt pursuant to section
74-107(1) or (24), Idaho Code, the petitioner shall be required to name as a
party and serve the person or entity that filed or provided such documents
to the agency, and such person or entity shall have standing to oppose the
request for disclosure and to support the decision of the agency to deny
the request. The time for responsive pleadings and for hearings in such
proceedings shall be set by the court at the earliest possible time, or in no
event beyond twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the date of filing.
(2) The public agency shall keep all documents or records in question
until the end of the appeal period, until a decision has been rendered on the
petition, or as otherwise statutorily provided, whichever is longer.
(3) Nothing contained in this chapter shall limit the availability
of documents and records for discovery in the normal course of judicial or
administrative adjudicatory proceedings, subject to the law and rules of
evidence and of discovery governing such proceedings. Additionally, in any
criminal appeal or post-conviction civil action, this chapter shall not make
available the contents of prosecution case files where such material has
previously been provided to the defendant nor shall this chapter be available to supplement, augment, substitute or supplant discovery procedures in
any other federal, civil or administrative proceeding.

cause why he should not do so. The court shall decide the case after examining the pleadings filed by the parties and such oral arguments and additional
evidence as the court may allow. The court may examine the record in camera
in its discretion.
(2) If the court finds that the public official's decision to refuse
disclosure is not justified, it shall order the public official to make the
requested disclosure. If the court determines that the public official was
justified in refusing to make the requested record available, he shall return the item to the public official without disclosing its content and shall
enter an order supporting the decision refusing disclosure. In any such action, the court shall award reasonable costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party or parties, if it finds that the request or refusal to provide
records was frivolously pursued.

faith in attempting to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

or a local agency.
(5) If a person or entity that receives a written notice and demand from
the state archivist pursuant to this chapter fails to deliver the described
records, fails to respond to the notice and demand within the required time,
or does not adequately demonstrate that the records do not belong to the
state or a local agency, the state archivist may ask the attorney general to
petition a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring the return
of the records.
(6) The court may issue any order necessary to protect the records from
destruction, alteration, transfer, conveyance or alienation by the person
or entity in possession of the records, and may order that the records be surrendered into the custody of the state archivist pending the court's decision on the petition.
(7) After a hearing, and upon a finding that the specified records are
in the possession of a person or entity not authorized by law to possess

Idaho Code on and after January 1, 2016, and which provides for confidentiality or closure of a public record or class of public records and is located at
a place other than this chapter shall be null, void and of no force and effect
regarding the confidentiality or closure of the public record and such pub-
30
lic record shall be open and available to the public for inspection as provided in this chapter.

74-123. IDAHO CODE IS PROPERTY OF THE STATE OF IDAHO. (1) The Idaho Code
is the property of the state of Idaho, and the state of Idaho and the taxpayers shall be deemed to have a copyright on the Idaho Code. If a person
reproduces or distributes the Idaho Code for the purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage, the person shall owe to the Idaho code commission, as the agent of the state of Idaho, a royalty fee in addition to the fee
charged for copying the Idaho Code. Any person who reproduces or distributes
the Idaho Code in violation of the provisions of this section shall be deemed
to be an infringer of the state of Idaho's copyright. The Idaho code commission, through the office of the attorney general, is entitled to institute
an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while the
Idaho code commission or its designated agent has custody of the Idaho Code.
(2) A court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under this
section may grant such relief as it deems appropriate. At any time while an
action under this section is pending, the court may order the impounding, on
such terms as it deems reasonable, of all copies claimed to have been made or
used in violation of the Idaho code commission's copyright pursuant to this
section.
(3) An infringer of the state of Idaho's copyright pursuant to this section is liable for any profits the infringer has incurred by obtaining the
Idaho Code for commercial purposes or is liable for statutory damages as provided in subsection (4) of this section.
(4) The Idaho code commission, as agent of the copyright owner, may
elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered, to recover, instead
of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to the Idaho Code for which
any one (1) infringer is liable individually, or for which any two (2) or
more infringers are liable jointly and severally, in a sum of not less than
two hundred fifty dollars ($250) and not more than ten thousand dollars
($10,000), as the court considers just.
(5) In any civil action under this section, the court may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party and may also award reasonable
attorney's fees to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
(6) The Idaho code commission is hereby authorized to license and
charge fees for the use of the Idaho Code. The Idaho code commission may
grant a license for the use of the Idaho Code to a public agency in the state
and waive all or a portion of the fees. All fees recovered by the Idaho code
commission shall be deposited in the general fund.

74-124. EXEMPTIONS FROM DISCLOSURE -- CONFIDENTIALITY. (1) Notwithstanding any statute or rule of court to the contrary, nothing in this chapter nor chapter 10, title 59, Idaho Code, shall be construed to require disclosure of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes by a
law enforcement agency, but such exemption from disclosure applies only to
the extent that the production of such records would:
(a) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
31
(b) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
(c) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(d) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a
record compiled by a criminal law enforcement agency in the course of a
criminal investigation, confidential information furnished only by the
confidential source;
(e) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
(f) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;
or
(g) Disclose the identity of a reporting party maintained by any law enforcement entity or the department of health and welfare relating to the
investigation of child abuse, neglect or abandonment unless the reporting party consents in writing to the disclosure or the disclosure of the
reporting party's identity is required in any administrative or judicial proceeding.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any person
involved in a motor vehicle collision which is investigated by a law enforcement agency, that person's authorized legal representative and the insurer
shall have a right to a complete, unaltered copy of the impact report, or its
successors, and the final report prepared by the agency.
(3) An inactive investigatory record shall be disclosed unless the
disclosure would violate the provisions of subsection (1)(a) through (g)
of this section. Investigatory record as used herein means information
with respect to an identifiable person or group of persons compiled by a
law enforcement agency in the course of conducting an investigation of a
specific act or omission and shall not include the following information:
(a) The time, date, location, and nature and description of a reported
crime, accident or incident;
(b) The name, sex, age, and address of a person arrested, except as otherwise provided by law;
(c) The time, date, and location of the incident and of the arrest;
(d) The crime charged;
(e) Documents given or required by law to be given to the person arrested;
(f) Informations and indictments except as otherwise provided by law;
and
(g) Criminal history reports.
As used herein, the term "law enforcement agency" means the office of
the attorney general, the office of the state controller, the Idaho state police, the office of any prosecuting attorney, sheriff or municipal police
department.
(4) Whenever it is made to appear by verified petition to the district
court of the county where the records or some part thereof are situated that
certain investigative records are being improperly withheld from a member of
the public, the court shall order the officer or person charged with withholding the records to disclose the investigative record or show cause why he
should not do so. The court shall decide the case after examining the record
in camera, papers filed by the parties, and such oral argument and additional
evidence as the court may allow.
If the court finds that the public official's decision to refuse disclosure is not justified, he shall order the public official to make the record
public. If the judge determines that the public official was justified in
32
refusing to make the record public, he shall return the item to the public
official without disclosing its content with an order supporting the decision refusing disclosure. Any person who fails to obey the order of the court
shall be cited to show cause why he is not in contempt of court. The court
may, in its discretion, award costs and fees to the prevailing party.

74-125. EVIDENCE FROM PRELIMINARY HEARING -- ADMISSION -- REQUIREMENTS. Prior to admitting into evidence recorded testimony from a
preliminary hearing, the court must find that the testimony offered is:
1. Offered as evidence of a material fact and that the testimony is more
probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which
the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and
2. That the witness is, after diligent and good faith attempts to locate, unavailable for the hearing; and
3. That at the preliminary hearing, the party against whom the admission of the testimony is sought had an adequate opportunity to prepare and
cross-examine the proffered testimony.
[74-125, added 2015, ch. 140, sec. 5, p. 368.]

made to the speaker of the house of representatives, and a copy of such request shall be contemporaneously submitted to the legislative services office. A public records request for the senate shall be made to the president
pro tempore of the senate, and a copy of such request shall be contemporaneously submitted to the legislative services office.
(3) A public records request for an individual legislator shall be made
to such individual legislator, and a copy of such request shall be contemporaneously submitted to the legislative services office.
(4) For purposes of this section, "contemporaneously" means that a copy
of a request for public records shall be submitted to the legislative services office on the same business day as the request is made.
(5) The legislature, either house of the legislature, or an individual
legislator shall not be obligated to respond to a public records request that
does not comply with the requirements of this section.
