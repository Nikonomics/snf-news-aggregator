39-3357. ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. (1) If the licensing agency finds, on the
basis of inspections as defined in this chapter or otherwise, that a residential or assisted living facility no longer meets a requirement of this chapter, and further finds that the facility's deficiencies:
(a) Immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents,
the department shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy
and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in section
39-3358(1)(c), Idaho Code, or prohibit the facility from keeping or
admitting residents and may provide, in addition, for one (1) or more of
the other remedies described in section 39-3358, Idaho Code.
(b) Do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the department shall provide for one (1) or more of the remedies
described in section 39-3358, Idaho Code.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the department to remedy a facility's deficiencies. If
the department finds that a facility meets the requirements of this chapter, but, as of a previous period, intentionally did not meet such requirements, the department may provide for a civil money penalty under section
20
39-3358(1)(b), Idaho Code, for the days in which it finds that the facility
was not in compliance with such requirements.
(3) Residential care or assisted living facilities may be cited only
for a violation of a requirement that is specified in an applicable law or
in a rule promulgated in compliance with an applicable law. Facilities may
not be cited for an act that is not expressly proscribed by an applicable law
or rule or for an omission when an applicable law or rule does not expressly
require the conduct omitted. If the department requires a specific corrective action in relation to a citation, that requirement must be in writing
and reference the corresponding rule.
(4) If a civil money penalty is assessed against a facility for deficiencies that do not require relocation of residents or facility closure,
the facility may use funds equal to the penalty amount to correct the deficiencies instead of paying the penalty. Documentation of expenditures addressing the deficiencies must be submitted to the department.
(5) Funds collected from such penalties, including those held by the
department on July 1, 2025, or collected after such date, may be used by facilities through a department-administered grant program to improve resident care and quality of life. The department shall establish guidelines and
a process for grant applications and fund distribution.

(a) Prohibit the facility from admitting residents or prohibit a facility from keeping or admitting residents with a specific diagnosis.
(b) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for
each day the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of
this chapter. Funds collected by the department as a result of imposition of such a penalty shall be applied to the protection of the health
or property of residents of residential or assisted living facilities
that the department finds deficient, including payment for the costs of

of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.
(c) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of
the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there is a need for temporary management while:
(i) There is an orderly closure of the facility.
(ii) Improvements are made in order to bring the facility into
compliance with all the requirements of this chapter.
(iii) The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated until the department has determined that the facility has

the requirements of this chapter.
(d) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to summarily suspend the
