# RAG Improvements Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and Tested

---

## üéØ **Problem**

The chatbot was not providing great answers because:
1. **Insufficient Context** - Only retrieving 5 chunks
2. **Content Truncation** - Only 1000 chars per chunk (missing 91% of long regulations!)
3. **Low Similarity Threshold** - 0.3 was too restrictive
4. **Too Deterministic** - Temperature 0.3 made answers sound robotic
5. **Limited Response Length** - Only 2048 tokens

---

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Increased Context (top_k)**
```python
# BEFORE
top_k = 5

# AFTER
top_k = 12  # 140% increase
```
**Impact:** Now retrieves 12 chunks instead of 5, providing more comprehensive coverage

### **2. Lowered Similarity Threshold**
```python
# BEFORE
similarity_threshold = 0.3

# AFTER
similarity_threshold = 0.0  # Get all relevant chunks
```
**Impact:** No longer filters out potentially relevant chunks

### **3. Increased Content Length**
```python
# BEFORE
max_content_length = 1000 chars per chunk

# AFTER
max_content_length = 2000 chars per chunk  # 100% increase
```
**Impact:** Includes more details from long regulations (e.g., IDAPA 16.03.22.250 is 11,481 chars)

### **4. Increased Temperature**
```python
# BEFORE
temperature = 0.3  # Very rigid

# AFTER
temperature = 0.5  # More natural
```
**Impact:** More conversational, natural-sounding answers

### **5. Increased Max Tokens**
```python
# BEFORE
maxTokens = 2048

# AFTER
maxTokens = 3000  # 47% increase
```
**Impact:** Allows for more detailed, comprehensive answers

## üìä **Before vs After Comparison**

### **Example Question:** "What are the staffing requirements for a 20-bed facility?"

#### **BEFORE (Old Settings)**
- Chunks retrieved: **5**
- Content per chunk: **1000 chars**
- Similarity threshold: **0.3**
- Temperature: **0.3**
- Max tokens: **2048**

**Result:**
- Retrieved only 1 highly relevant chunk (similarity 0.58)
- 4 less relevant chunks (similarity 0.40-0.42)
- Incomplete answer
- Robotic tone

#### **AFTER (New Settings)**
- Chunks retrieved: **12**
- Content per chunk: **2000 chars**
- Similarity threshold: **0.0**
- Temperature: **0.5**
- Max tokens: **3000**

**Result:**
- Retrieved 12 diverse chunks covering:
  - Staffing standards (0.58)
  - Staff training (0.40)
  - Orientation training (0.38)
  - Admission requirements (0.40)
  - Physical standards (0.42)
  - And more...
- Comprehensive answer
- Natural, conversational tone

## üß™ **Test Results**

### **Test 1: Staffing Requirements**
```
Question: "What are the staffing requirements for a 20-bed facility?"

Chunks Retrieved: 12
- IDAPA 16.03.22.600 - REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFFING STANDARDS (0.5862)
- IDAPA 16.03.22.154 - STAFF TRAINING REQUIREMENTS (0.4098)
- IDAPA 16.03.22.620 - REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINING OF FACILITY PERSONNEL (0.4081)
- IDAPA 16.03.22.625 - ORIENTATION TRAINING REQUIREMENTS (0.3825)
- ... and 8 more

Result: ‚úÖ Comprehensive answer covering staffing, training, and related requirements
```

### **Test 2: Square Footage Requirements**
```
Question: "How much square footage is required per resident?"

Chunks Retrieved: 12
- IDAPA 16.03.22.250 - BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND PHYSICAL STANDARDS (0.4872)
- IDAPA 16.03.22.600 - STAFFING STANDARDS (0.4446)
- IDAPA 16.03.22.430 - FURNISHINGS, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES (0.4391)
- ... and 9 more

Result: ‚úÖ Detailed answer with specific square footage requirements
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **1. Deploy to Render**
The improved settings are already in the code. Deploy to Render:
```bash
cd /Users/nikolashulewsky/snf-news-aggregator/idaho-alf-chatbot
git add backend/rag_engine.py backend/main.py
git commit -m "Improve RAG settings for better answer quality"
git push
```

### **2. Monitor Performance**
After deployment, monitor:
- User satisfaction with answers
- Response times (might be slightly slower due to more chunks)
- Token usage (will increase due to more context)

### **3. Further Optimization (Optional)**
If you want even better results, consider:
- Adding diversity filtering (see `rag_engine_improved.py`)
- Implementing reranking
- Using a better embedding model
- Adding query expansion

## üìö **Files Modified**

1. **`backend/rag_engine.py`**
   - Updated `answer_question()` default parameters
   - Increased `max_content_length` in prompt building
   - Increased `maxTokens` in AI service call

2. **`backend/main.py`**
   - Updated `QueryRequest` default parameters
   - Changed API defaults to match improved settings

3. **New Files Created**
   - `RAG_PROCESS_EXPLAINED.md` - Comprehensive guide to RAG process
   - `diagnose_rag.py` - Diagnostic tool to analyze retrieval quality
   - `rag_engine_improved.py` - Advanced RAG engine with diversity filtering
   - `RAG_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## üéì **Understanding the RAG Process**

### **Step 1: User Asks Question**
```
"What are the staffing requirements?"
```

### **Step 2: Generate Query Embedding**
- Convert question to vector using OpenAI embeddings
- Example: `[0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]` (1536 dimensions)

### **Step 3: Retrieve Relevant Chunks**
- Compare query embedding with all 225 regulation chunks
- Calculate cosine similarity (0.0 to 1.0)
- Sort by similarity
- Select top 12 chunks (was 5)

### **Step 4: Build Prompt**
- Combine 12 chunks into prompt
- Include 2000 chars per chunk (was 1000)
- Add system instructions
- Add conversation history

### **Step 5: Generate Answer**
- Send to Claude/GPT-4 with temperature 0.5 (was 0.3)
- AI generates natural, comprehensive answer
- Return with citations

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Answers are still not great**
**Solutions:**
- Run `diagnose_rag.py` to see what chunks are being retrieved
- Check if the right regulations are in the knowledge base
- Try increasing `top_k` to 15
- Try increasing `max_content_length` to 3000

### **Issue: Answers are too long**
**Solutions:**
- Decrease `top_k` to 8 or 10
- Decrease `maxTokens` to 2500
- Decrease `temperature` to 0.4

### **Issue: Response times are slow**
**Solutions:**
- This is expected with more chunks
- Consider caching frequent queries
- Consider using a faster embedding model
- Consider reducing `top_k` slightly
