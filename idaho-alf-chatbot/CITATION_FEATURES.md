## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **Backend**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Citation Matching**
The system matches citations using two methods:
1. **Citation Text Match**: `reg.citation === citation.citation`
2. **Chunk ID Match**: `reg.chunk_id === citation.chunk_id`

### **Modal Integration**
When a citation is clicked:
1. System finds the full regulation in the regulations list
2. Sets `selectedRegulation` state
3. Modal automatically opens with full content
4. User can read the regulation or click "Ask about this regulation"

### **Error Handling**
- If a regulation is not found, citation shows grayed out
- Hover shows "Regulation not available"
- Click does nothing (graceful degradation)

2. **Verification**: Users can click to read the full regulation text
3. **Trust**: Academic-style citations increase credibility
