# Claude Code Project Rules

## Automatic Documentation System

### File Updates
This project uses three automatically maintained documentation files:

1. **CONTEXT.md** - Comprehensive project context for new chats
2. **PROJECT_LOG.md** - Detailed log of actions and decisions
3. **TODO.md** - Active, prioritized to-do list

### Update Rules

#### CONTEXT.md Updates
Update whenever there's a significant change to:
- Project understanding or architecture
- Tech stack or key dependencies
- File structure or organization
- Important design decisions
- Current phase or status

Must always include:
- Project name and primary purpose (1-2 sentences)
- Current project status and phase
- Tech stack and key dependencies
- File structure overview
- Key architecture decisions and rationale
- How the project works (important context)
- Quirks, gotchas, or important notes
- Recent significant changes or progress
- Current priorities and next steps
- Blockers or issues

Keep concise but complete - readable in 2-3 minutes.

#### PROJECT_LOG.md Updates
Update after completing any meaningful task. Track:
- Date and time of significant actions
- What was implemented or changed
- Why decisions were made
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Test results and validations

**Never delete entries - only append.**

#### TODO.md Updates
Update after every conversation turn where tasks are:
- Discussed
- Completed
- Added
- Blocked

Maintain sections:
- High priority tasks (at top)
- In-progress items (with status)
- Blocked items (with reason)
- Done section (with completion dates)

Each item should include brief context about why it matters.

**Move completed items to "Done" section rather than deleting.**

### End of Session Protocol
At the end of each conversation session, ask if a comprehensive update of all three files is needed.
