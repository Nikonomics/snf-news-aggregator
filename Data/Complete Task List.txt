Mock external APIs to avoid hitting rate limits. Achieve minimum 80% code coverage. Run tests automatically on every commit.

**TASK: Build integration tests for API endpoints**
Test all REST API endpoints to verify: correct HTTP status codes returned, proper authentication/authorization checks, accurate data returned, pagination works correctly, filters apply properly, error responses formatted correctly. Test with real database (separate test database, not production). Run before every deployment.

Generate daily report of any issues found.

**TASK: Build load testing for APIs**
Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate high traffic: test with 100, 500, 1000 concurrent users hitting various endpoints. Measure response times under load (target: <500ms for 95th percentile). Identify bottlenecks and optimize queries/caching before they become production issues. Run load tests before major releases.

**TASK: Build ETL job monitoring tests**
Create tests that verify scheduled jobs are running on time: check data_refresh_log table for recent successful runs, alert if any job hasn't run when expected, verify record counts match expectations (no massive drops or spikes), check for stuck jobs, monitor job duration (alert if taking much longer than normal).

**TASK: Test data privacy controls**
Verify GDPR/CCPA compliance: users can export their data, users can delete their accounts and data is actually removed, data retention policies are enforced, cookies properly disclosed, opt-in consent properly implemented, third-party data sharing properly documented and controlled.

### 10.4 Performance Testing

**TASK: Run database query optimization**
Use database profiling tools to identify slow queries: review all queries taking >100ms, add indexes where appropriate, optimize JOIN operations, use query explain plans to understand execution. Test with production-size datasets to ensure queries scale. Target: all API endpoints respond in <500ms.

**TASK: Implement frontend performance testing**
Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest to measure: First Contentful Paint (<1.8s), Largest Contentful Paint (<2.5s), Time to Interactive (<3.8s), Cumulative Layout Shift (<0.1), Total page size (<2MB). Optimize images, minimize JavaScript, implement lazy loading, use code splitting.
